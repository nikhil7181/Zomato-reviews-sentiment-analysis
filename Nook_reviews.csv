2,The food was average overall..the prawns were pretty bad although highly expensive. They brought in food after 6-7 follow ups. Service is the worst. Our breads came in 30 minutes post the main courses which were already cold.
1,Poor Quality Food with slow service. Desserts and starters were especially bad. Asked for lime soda without ice but they got it very cold.
5,Nook has become one of my favourite places to eat in the recent past. Not just because it's a part of #alofthotels. But because of the different food festivals they keep having in this place. The last time I visited they had this amazing Chettinad food festival. Where there were so many dishes and the taste was simply awesome.This time i went there it was the Uttarakhand food festival. The chefs were from that place and they had some super duper food. The chutneys from that region were so many and rich. The food tasted lovely and overall enjoyed the concepts these guys give.The prices is just 1155 plus tax. Which is very affordable. Keeping in mind that this is located in a hotel.For more visit us on platewithflavours in INSTAGRAM
4,The place does not have a concentrated sitting area but itÇÑs spread whole across the lobby on ground floor of aloft Hotel On Wednesday and Friday you get live band playing and Tuesday nights and ladies night with free alcohol for the ladies Offers a decent variety of beers whiskeys and cocktails.Come here with friends and you would enjoy for sure.
4,"I was staying in aloft for a weekend hence got to try their breakfast buffet.I liked the overall quality and taste of the food here. Chhole Puri and aloo ki sabzi were great. They had proper North Indian taste. Apart from that, i also liked their carrot cake and banana cake as they were fresh and soft to the core. I also tried kesar rasmalai and baked yoghurt in desserts as the night snack. Though Kesar rasmalai was average but baked yoghurt was tasty. Added fruits were parting their flavour to the yoghurt.Ambience was nice. Place was spacious with good ceiling decorations with good jazz music in background.Service was awesome. Chef Akash was very interactive and was constantly making sure my orders are served well in time. As a good gesture, he offered a pastry to me during one of the breakfast. He was nice to talk to and was suggesting dishes to eat when he came to know I am north indian which will best suit my taste.Ambience: 3.5Food: 4Service: 5"
5,The place is very nice to chill with your friends and family. Food is awesome. You will find all range of food starting from Indian to Chinese and Mexican.You can make your own salad here too. Chicken wings was awesome followed with baked fish.I liked the ambiance too. Staffs over here are very polite and friendly too. I was so busy on my food didn't got to take pics. Every time when I visit this place they never let me down.Hope to see you soon
2,Visisted it last month for office lunch which turned out to be a disappointed experience.Buffet Spread is not so great and overall food is also not tasty.Overall not worth the price paid as there are other options in close proximity which are better for buffet.
4,"Fantastic breakfasts with a super friendly staff, and a hyper-friendly Chef Jishnu awaits you when you eat here. Food spread is nice, although i would seek some improvements in the oriental dishes. Overall, great experiences."
1,"A completely worst place for buffet. Located in such a star hotel and expectation of buffet from such place is obviously high. Coming to spread, it's a huge spread yet i think it's just for presentation. I didn't find any edible starters over there. All were displayed under a heating lamp. Food was extremely cold. Do you think of putting pizzas on buffet counter!! . Salad counter was just okay. Maincourse was mediocre. Not even a single item tasted good. Food was cold. Completely its a cold buffet place. Dessert was okay.Service needs attention."
4,"Visited this place two times for office get together. Located on the outer ring road in the Cessna Business Park is apt for any office get together. It offers beautiful ambience, prompt service, array of options in its dinner buffet with lovely service that makes it ideal for a lovely time. Absolutely recommend this place."
2,"Stayed in the hotel for a week, okay experience not so overwhelming.Used to have breakfast every morning good options but had to explain everything how you want it otherwise it will be served uncooked to you.Found 'hair' in stuffed aaloo paratha once told it to floor incharge got is replaced but considering it is a 5 star hotel it shouldn't have happened.Hotel staff is friendly and make you feel at home.Good luck if you're planning to stay!"
2,The place has a decent ambience which you can expect from a restaurant in a 5 star hotel. The food however is average at best and extremely expensive on top of that.
4,"Perfect place for a leisurely breakfast which leaves you feeling good. Loved the cheese platter, fresh fruits and eggs.Service and ambience are the Cherry on the cake"
5,Overall a very good experience. Many options in dinner buffet.Masala cheese omlette - very goodDal makhani - very good.Vada - very goodHash brown potato - very goodSevai - goodaaloo kulcha - goodtandoori naan - goodtomato shorba - goodMomo's - goodpaneer aapki pasand - 4/5Masala dosa - 4/5Aloo paratha - 4/5
5,"This place rocks!!! That's how I would like to start my review. I have tried their breakfast buffet and also the Chettinad Samayal during a festival. You can never go wrong with this place.Ç Their breakfast spread is humongous and you are spoilt for choice. They have a varitey of Indian (North and South), Continental, Pan Asian delicacies for breakfast not to forget the healthy options that are served in a separate counter. They even offer soy milk, almond milk other than your regular juices, shakes, smoothies etc. They offer a lot of fresh and seasonal fruits. I haven't seen a better range of cheese being offered anywhere. The service is top-notch and they are willing to customize items to suit your palate.I am a vegetarian and went there during the Chettinad festival as well. The chef and his team ensured that I got to taste the true Chettinad delicacies like Raw Banana, vada , Curries made of okra, conconut rice etc. Truly impressed.They would get a perfect 5 on all counts. Must visit !!!"
5,A best place for buffet breakfast in weekend morning. I went there while I was on my Bangalore trip. A good restaurant indeed. Lots of varieties of different kind of foods. Starting from live food counter to delicious ready food.Pocket pinch : HighAmbience : Very goodFood Quality : ExcellentService : ExcellentOverall rating : Very Good.Must visit place for food lovers.
4,"Been there few times. Love their assortment of salads. Sometimes they have chaat corner. The tawa options are yum too. Main course options are too many for greedy eater to choose from. And then the desert spread is just wow.The attentiveness is low. Cleanliness is tad bit affected due to this. Also to pay, almost every time, had to wait 20 mins."
5,"Was here for the Chettinad Samayal - my first experience of the cuisine. There were some brilliant appetizers like Then Kuzhel, Kuzhi Paniyaram, Vella Appam with Daanger, Keerai Vada, Meen Varuval. I loved the Appam. Reminded me of Kanji Vadas!There was Drumstick Soup - called as Murungakai soup.The highlight of the mela were Paruppu Kadaisal (Dal)with some jeera rice, Vendakai Pachadi (Ladyfinger), Tamarind Rasam among the lots of options that I savored.The Badam Halwa is a must try! çThis is only available until the 24th of this month for lunch or dinner. Nice job by Chef Murthy and team †"
4,Pretty cool place I must say and ambience makes it more worthy when you visit just to relax the work pressure you already had. Food is really nice with awesome varieties and the best thing about this place is they try something innovation. Best advantage is if you are working in Cessna or near ORR its a great place for outdoor Lunch.
5,"A breezy day in Bangalore by the pool at Nook would be my idea of the perfect brunch. It's undoubtedly my favourite. Every time I have been here, I get overwhelmed with the sheer variety of food. Tens of types of desserts, starters, pancakes, breads, sea food - you name it. The friendliest staff in Bangalore, and that of course elevates the whole experience.Favourites:Ç Live pancake/waffle - you can choose the flavour and the toppings and it's made right there.Live seafood - pick any fish/prawn, it's cooked right thereDesserts - I love light desserts, not too sweet but still flavourful. TheyÇ never disappoint.Vibes: Relaxed, airy, cosmopolitan."
5,"Courteous and nice kind staff, lavish food spread with good taste and balance of nutrition, yummy masala teaÇÄùÇÄù must try. . And I hate this 140char limit"
5,Loved Chicken Chettinad - Chef Murthy is the best. Thank you very much Chef. A must try dish with authentic flavour and ground roast spices.
5,Had lunch at Nook recently. I ordered from the menu Grilled Salmon and it was perfectly done. The flavour was great. It was came with the right sides to complement the Salmon. I am a big fan of Salmon and I have tried it in many restaurants and this one definitely stood out.
5,I follow a simple rule before visiting any place for food. I read the reviews and decide the best things to try at that place. I did the same before going to Aloft. But believe me the reviews here in zomato didn't do justice to the food quality. Every single food item was perfect to its test. I wont be mentioning all details but you can guess from the pictures I have shared how much I have gulped down.Note: Deserts were very few for vegetarians.
3,Had a dinner here with work colleagues. Dinner went fine and the food was good. I thought I would pick up some dessert to take home. Looked at the menu and the tiramisu sounded good.At home I discovered I paid 513 for a bowl of whipped cream dusted with cocoa powder. Nothing else.
3,"Restaurant is good. I didn't find any wow factor in it.We opted for buffet. Soup wasn't good. They had tomato soup and rasam in the soup section. Food was good. Starters had items with cheese, steamed veggies, deep fried mushrooms, veggies etc. Too many options for people who love salads with vaiety of vegetables and fruits. They have sugar free sweets, vegan desserts. They also had variety in dessert section apart from sugar free and vegan desserts.I heard from 1 of my family member that, non-veg is not at all good.Hosts were not that great. I think you have to work towards that. They just came to get the bill paid."
1,"Aloft has been designed uniquely with vibrant colour shades all over and a snooker table, high stools giving it a very youthful look and nook is neatly tucked into the lobby, we went for lunch buffet and the spread of buffet was not vast, taste of the food and desserts was average, everything in the buffet was cold and the live counter doesnÇÑt serve pizza or pasta, service was bad and overall not a great experience!Buffet Included:\tÇ\t1 Veg & 1 Non-Veg SoupÇ®\tÇ\t2 Veg & 2 Non-Veg startersÇ®\tÇ\t10 Main Course Ç®\tÇ\t10 Salad ,1 Veg & 1 Non Veg Ç®\tÇ\tBreadsÇ®\tÇ\t2 Rice Ç®\tÇ\t12 Cold DessertsÇ®Cost:1296 AI/PP"
1,"My Experience was not that great hereI have visited this place on last Thursday (this is my first visit to this place).The restaurant is almost full we wait for long time,Finally we got the table after 20 minutes ,Ambience is pretty good........................Coming to the food......................We went for buffet, service is good and the food quality OMG horrible. From soup to dessert ÄòΩÄòΩÄòΩÄòΩÄòΩÄòΩÄòΩEverything was cold soup, starter, main course.I will never recommend this place to anyone.If you are maintaining star category hotel.How can you serve this kind of food to your customer.The service was too slowAmbiance 3/5Food........ 1/5Service.... 1/5Higine...... 1/5Value for money .....0/5"
4,"Went for a team lunch with colleagues today. We had the Lunch buffet. The buffet is approximately 1100 INR per person. Vegetarian food variety wasnÇÑt very impressive (the paapdi chat & vegetable nuggets were good), but the Non vegetarian spread was very very good, especially the Chicken salad, Egg salad, Grilled fish & all fish items. The cuisine included Asian delicacies mainly. The dessert spread was also very good. Loved the ambience, service and the food( me being a hardcore non vegetarian food lover Ç).Would definitely recommend as a good option for team lunches and dinners.Suggestion to the hotel authorities & the chief chef: Please bring in more variety in the Vegetarian category.My rating : 4/5Will I recommend the place: YesWill I visit again: Yes"
4,"Had been here for the team lunch. Ambience is quite nice. Food is good and the buffet spread is amazing. Some how I felt customer service could have been better, hence one star less."
2,"Unbelievable!!!! Horrible!!!! How can a star category hotel offers cold buffet. Not even a single item was hot even hot desserts were also ice cold.Ambience is nice, thus 1* for this. Cream of Tomato soup was okay. I didn't find a proper display of starters. They were meshed up with oriental and continental main course. May be taste was good at the time of fresh preparation. Those were just placed under a heating lamp, not under any hot top to keep the food warm.Another 1* is for salads. Those were good with varieties. Coming to main course varieties were less and all were cold. No prawn item on the buffet. No one was customer service oriented there.Desserts were just okay. Less indian dessert spread. Only ladoo, paneer jalebi, rice kheer and falooda. Rice kheer was ice cold and vermicelli inside falooda was hard. Western dessert spread was also not upto the mark. Ice cream was melted and chocolate pudding was cold.Service was just okay. Table mat, side plates, spoon and fork were dirty too.Not a place to recommend ÄòΩÄòΩFood - 1/5Service - 3/5Ambience - 4/5Value for money - 0/5"
3,The ambience is quite nice full of 5 star vibes. They also gave a complimentary papad basket. But the food was ok-ish at max. Tried salmon caesar salad for the first time and it was a complete disaster. Not sure if that is the case at other places as well. Pasta was also too dry. Service is good with people asking for regular feedbacks.
4,"summary : excellent lunch buffet although a bit expensiveOrder : the lunch BuffetFood (4.5/5): The spread here is excellent; a variety of salads including a mix of vegetarian and nonvegetarian; range of starters , good main course and excellent desserts, at least 10 varieties in fact.Amogst the startera, I especially liked the dahi papdi chat, tangy. Didnt try much of the salads but the chickpea was good. The vegetarian Pizza was best and worth a try ; the base soft, the cheese generous with a variety of toppings. The chicken wings and garlic noodles were ok.There were a couple of other starters but it was time for The main course.The nan was good with the paneer curry; the bhindi was average though. The chicken biryani and veg pulao ended my main course. There is a live counter which serves pasta but I needed space for the desserts.The deserts were spread out with at least 10 varieties; Malpua , the chocolate cake, pastries all totally worth it.Ambiance (4/5) : fine dining ambiance.Value for money (4/5)"
5,"It's always delicious and wonderful here. The hospitality, taste and ambience make it one of favorite place to have my brunch. :-)Harvinder and Mahender you guys are awesome! Keep it up."
4,After being to Aloft brown is t new love for me. Amazing banana cakes & chocolate cupcakes thought the croissant was not as good as it was the last time
5,Had great experience of one night stay @aloft. Really happy with the services provided by staff especially harvinder. He is very polite and helpful for getting things available at disposal.
5,"The Grandiose food fest dedicated for konkani cuisine which started from jan 14th to 25 jan 2019. This Konkan Katta cuisine is all the way from coastal region of mangalore with all kind of authentic Konkani dishes like seafood, exotic vegetables @Nook- multi-cuisine .. food is the key ingredient that makes a fabulous community. Specially Seafood lovers with love this fest. They do have many veg options."
3,"My experience was not that great here, I went with my team on a buffet dinner, I liked the ambiance. The main course and starters were good but I did not like the dessert part. They have a pretty good options on food and drinks."
5,"Perfect place for team and family time. Nice food, superb interior design. Perfect place. You need to enter cessena tech park. It's visible from main road."
2,"Went here for a team dinner and surprisingly it was not a very good experience. It has a good ambience but the you can't go just for ambience, the starters were cold and not very tasty. The main course had a very limited options. The most surprising was even their ice cream was bad. Really disappointed!!!Note: This is the review for the veg buffet."
4,"The well introduced brunch was excellent and had variety of items in the veg as well as non veg brunch .The drinks were also great and the alcoholic package for the brunch was proper mix of drinks and food items, enjoyed a lot ."
5,"Had breakfast buffet which was really awesome in taste... Huge spread,very friendly staff n nice ambience. Enjoyed my day. Would love to visit again§Äî"
4,Had been here for cake mixing event. Had wonderful brunch scene with friends. We enjoyed very much and had lots of fun. Loved their desserts. Chef Aniket Done a wonderful job.
5,"What would you do if someone said eat all you can and then pay whatever you want? Dream come true rytÄö this place is just like that.. The breakfast buffet.. The spread is so huge.. The food is amazing.. So is the ambience and the service but the best part is you get all this for just 295rs all inclusive.. Thats where it becomes a dream come true. The spread is so huge and food is soo good.. You will yourself feel 300rs is too less for all this.I wouldn't mind going here every sunday, cause with all that variety at that price.. Its always a great deal."
4,Came here for my orientation for the new job. One of the few restaurants that does the aesthetics and the food presentation right. Every food item is in the right location. Separated but not too far. You always know what you are looking for. Desserts are good but the buffet items were missing key dishes. Felt there could have been a few more items on the menu.
5,"I was here last weekend for a lavish Sunday Brunch at poolside followed by a Christmas cake mixing ceremony. I always enjoy my visit to any of the Marriott properties. The staffs at Marriott hotels are very professional and best when it comes to unparallel hospitality. At Aloft also the story is no different. The Execute Chef - Aniket Das and his team made a fabulous ÇBrunch by the BlueÇÑ spread which left us with no words.A sunny afternoon at the beautiful poolside with live music and sparkling wine in my hand made me hungry enough to check out the live food counters. There were separate sections for salads, Cheese and bread, Italian, Chinese, Grill stations (for Veg, non ÇÄ veg and seafood), Main course and desserts.I tried a small plate of mixed salads, Chicken roulade, spicy grilled chicken & prawns, and a portion of chicken and mushroom pizza. For the main course, I tried Chicken Biryani, Kadhi Pakoda, and Dal. By then I heard a lot about the main course especially for the Meen Kulambu and Nalli Nihaari. Sadly I couldnÇÑt try those as we getting late for the cake mixing ceremony.If not for any other dishes, just go for this brunch only for their desserts. It was pure art in different forms, colors, flavors, and shapes. We always go gaga over International Chefs who create beautiful pastries. We should learn to appreciate our local Chefs first. They are so talented and can match the International standards for sure. Everything was so heavenly especially the Macarons, Orange Delice and Mango Entremet ÇÄ French desserts at its best. Overall I enjoyed a great brunch in recent times. They also had Indian desserts like Rasgulla, barfi, and lot more."
5,"Soak some sunshine with a wide spread of lipsmacking menu by pool-side curated by chef Aniket. Yesterday I enjoyed my Sunday brunch followed by a cake-mixing event there. Live music to sooth your soul around the pool with a breezy air. The place is perfect for Family too.you can relax in the pool with a glass of sparkling wine While enjoying some delicious seafood preparations from the live counter. They also have Live Pasta counters , Pancakes , salads and Indian traditional Delicacies that you can't miss them at all. The desserts table was so colorful and every piece of that was worthy to try. Loved my experience and would surely like to recommend.Food - 5/5Ambience- 5/5"
5,"Sumptuous breakfast, Good spread, Kicker value for money, Pleasant staff. We had a great time. It was not crowded either. Kids ran around enjoying the open spaces around."
5,"We went there last week for dinner and we all loved the food and service. Place looks beautiful, waiters were helpful. Over all good experience."
5,"Hello Raju, thank you for your great, humble service! Keep doing better!This place is excellent for an early breakfast. It's got the right menu with a balance of everything."
3,"The service was too slow. The starters tasted the best in all of our orders. We had ordered a pasta which was too chewy and too dry, we had to ask the chef a couple of times to make it better. In main course the murg musallam was too bland in taste. Not the best place for main course."
4,A superb spread of buffet and a very dignified ambiance with a good staff .Food - amazingSpread - unique and good qualitySitting - as per standards of aloft
5,"One of the best place to visit, Loved the ambience and the food!I would rate 9/10 for the ambience. Starting with the food, the platter for veg was daumn good, it had all the veg starters in it One gravy was sufficient for 4 of them. Make sure you choose the best with the help of Bharath, finally loved the desert which was made specially for me. Just look into my photos for the identity. At last happy food!"
5,One of the best place to visit..... It has amazing food and excellent service thanks shubham really appreciate... Keep doing the same work... All the best
5,Awesome place one must visit thanks Kamal for such a lovely experience will be looking forward to see you soon ...the is too good must try rawa dosa it's the best ....
5,I came for breakfast today .... must say huge selection of food ..... on top of service was acting as a cherry on the cake ...thanks to kamal for it ...
2,"Been here for a team lunch and i felt we shouldnÇÑt be visiting here again. I had booked a table for 16 and when we arrived, we were taken to a table of 14. When we asked for a change of table, they just snuck in a couple of chairs and made it 16. It was quite uncomfortable. We werenÇÑt given the drinks menu either and nobody briefed us about the buffet. It was like we were there to fend for ourselves. The food was good but nothing great or special that we wouldnÇÑt find elsewhere. I am going to make sure our team never chooses this place. Very bad service!"
5,"so great, wonderful experience! Aloft is your best choice! Food is good and rich, self-aid breakfast so great, service is so great, The gym also wonderful, you can do sports everday."
5,"Awesome food and ambience Staff is very friendly, Raju , Kajal and Geet were very helpful Highly recommend for Everything especially South Indian!!"

5,Amazing place. Had been for the sunday brunch by the poolside.Good food and ambience. They have an array of options. Huge Buffet spread.Cheerful and attentive staff. Would like to appreciate Suman and team (apologies for not remembering the names). Amazing bunch of people. Would definitely visit again.
4,"So we happened to choose this place so as to try out a different option which is closer to the office for our team dinner.Well when we arrived here we were taken back, we were not expecting this big of a hotel inside the tech park which had a good Ambience closer to the office which we never noticed as this is a bit inside.Food wise they have a nice spread and they have South Indian delicacies as well.They should improvise on the taste as well as couple of items were bit bland. But overall the food was fine.It has a cozy and calm atmosphere where you can sit and relax and enjoy your food and drinks.Do note this is not a party place but a proper corporate restaurant, so the crowd is well behaved and polite.The staff here were also very polite and helpful.Well recommended for corporate gatherings and for family gathering where you want to have a calm atmosphere."
5,"We came out for dinner at the Nook restaurant today on the ocassion of my wife's birthday. The food quality, taste and ambience is simply awesome. Kudos to the chef's and the friendly staff that assisted. Special call out for Harvinder. Thanks all."

4,"I went to Nook just to try their breakfast buffet. Priced at 250+taxes, this is one of the best breakfast buffets available in the area, and possibly in the entire city. And the ambience of the restaurant is amazing, one of the best I have seen. Really colourful and vibrant and lively, it wakes you up and puts a smile on your face.Their spread is really good and has enough options to satisfy both Indian and non-Indian guests. The staff here is quite friendly and try to fulfill your requests and provide help without asking.The only thing I didn't like was the Kiwi ÇíYoghurt which was too strong and the Waffles which had a raw eggy taste. Other than that everything was fine.Special thanks to Harvinder for his polite nature and helpful attitude. Would definitely visit again !!"
5,"The buffet spread was very good and eye appealing . I loved the place and it's decor , people at restaurant are polite and good . Thank you ∫Øè"
5,"So I Was here for breakfast this morning, and there is wide variety of food choices. A big shoutout to the amazing and friendly staff :) one stopped me just in time from adding salt to my coffee :)"
2,"Last weekend (19th Aug) since the weather was cloudy during evening , I was craving for good cup of cappuccino so after looking for few nearby options (near my home) we settled for Aloft. I have been there before thrice and liked their food and hospitality but after my last visit , I would never want to go back. Right from the time we sat in, we were expected to place our order, well nothing wrong in that except that we were not given the menu card and not even water. I requested for that and told the server to give me atleast 5 min time to go through the menu and we will then place our order. Our order was lassi, cappuccino , club sandwich and an Asian chicken. Given that it was Sunday , we wanted to not hurry since the restaurant was empty at 5pm in evening and we wanted to just enjoy. The food started coming in and our server gave us the vibe that he just wanted to finish clearing our table and wanted us to leave so much so that when there was already full amount of chicken in the plate, he was checking if he could clear that away knowing that we were still having food. That experience was completely turn off. This wonÇÑt be my first time dining out and I have never experienced something like that and would never want to. All in all I would say the ambience is okish, food is average and the service for us didnÇÑt worked well. It is what you have experienced and I would like to give it as a 2."
5,"First time here, and it was great. The staff is really friendly and hospitable. The dosa is great; had one every morning! The chefs come out and speak to you; they really care that you enjoy the food! The staff is very hospitable!"
5,"Wonderful place. Its Right next to Cisco, so if you are tired after work, really nice place to be. Just sit back and relax. I was attended by Kamal, he was really polite and sweet. Good place overall."
5,Lots of varieties in the breakfast. The live counters are worth trying out. Enjoyed with my family. Great ambience and hospitality. Thank you Nook team!
5,Very welcoming love the placeThe staff is very friendly Mahi is a Rockstar I have come so many times And each time it a new experienceLove the place .....
5,"Maahi was a good server. We enjoyed the breakfast at Nook. Ambience, food was very nice. First time in banglore Aloft. Had a great start for the day."
5,"An amazing place with friendly, courteous and thoroughly professional staff.. The chef DEFINITELY needs a special mention! A must try is the Cream of Mushroom Soup and Thai curry with Jasmine Rice. Overall a wonderful experience and a great time! Thank you guys."
4,"A good place for team lunch. It has good non-veg options as well as options of cuisine. The taste of the food was good in the non-veg side (since, I'm non-vegetarian, I didn't take much on the veg side). If you are looking for a posh place for team lunch, I think maybe you will like it."
4,"I went for Sunday brunch. Food wise I think this is one of the best..I have not seen any restaurant who serves lobster in a brunch. the overall spread and the quality of food is spot on. The open bar kind of creates a familiar atmosphere. So it's a good setting for a large group. However for family with kids, it's slightly uncomfortable setting and lacks a sense of privacy. Also felt bad that they charged for alocholic rate for my wife who doesn't drink!!!"
5,"i visited along with my friends.food quality is awesome and delicious.different type chicken dishes are available, continental food , Chinese,and different types of sweets and desert also available.Nice and Polite gentle behavior...Thanks to Aloft Members."
2,"Pathetic service on weekend! Reserved table for a friends get-together on a Saturday. While making the booking they confirmed that there will be buffet. But, next day just before arriving at the restaurant, someone calls to inform that they don't have buffet. Is that the time to inform???Reached the place at 12noon and they were still setting the tables. There was hardly any customer service. No one cared to take the order, and someone will come to attend after calling multiple times. Food took its sweet own time to arrive at the table. Even a simple french-fries took close to 30mins.Ç Once the food arrived, no one was courteous enough to even serve at the table. Overall experience was HORRIBLE. Will never ever visit the place."
4,"Waiters don't attend to you but food is good. Loved the bread items, pasta, veg platter. All were decent. Had a long wait before we could order or get the bill"
4,A great place for a business lunch! The place has some pretty good salad options and the thali is quite good too! Gets a bit crowded on a weekday lunch hour but the buffet is kept well stocked all the time. Don't go here expecting a quiet place for conversations though :) the constant in flow of large teams makes the noise levels slightly on the higher side! :)Ambience : 4/5Value for Money : 4/5Food : 4/5Service : 4/5
3,"An ambient place, good seating, sufficient spread, helpful staff ... all good but the food was not up to our expectations. Our meat eating friends got a raw (read undercooked) fish while we vegetarians had plenty of salt in our soup. Some stuff was good but some like vilayti subji were a mockery of us who think posh = better quality.Given the fact that it is costly on lesser mortals(read masses) this place needs improvement in the quality of food being served."
5,"The staff has been amazingly helpful. They are very cooperative. I like the helpful nature of all the staffs special shout out for ATIF, ANIMESH, JISHNU, SUMAN AND MAHINDRA cos they r very courteous friendly and professional."
1,The service staff needs to be trained to work efficiently and be courteous. It seemed they were too lazy to work and least bothered about the guests. A disappointing experience from a business hotel.While the food was really good. But the service just ruins the entire experience.
2,Very bad service..No one cares once you are in food was 1hour after order was taken and bill was given 30mins post requested..Had thalis ..Food was ok not bad and not so good.. Definitely won't visit again..
5,"First of all, I would appreciate the hospitability by the NOOK staff. Guest satisfaction is on priority for the staff. The ambience, Food is great and the staff are very interactive. what else in house guest needs. Special Thanks to Mr Bharat for his warm welcome and help to explore the varieties of Veg items out of the box. At the same time, Mahi, Ghose and jishnuÇ always take care of guest choices and their smile get us to ride ofÇ whole day tirednessÇ :)."
5,"I liked the food and the service very much , they have set buffet very nicely the staff is very young and friendly , ......... I would like to visit this restaurant again and again...."
4,"5th experience in Saturday morning and the breakfast buffet still is as good as it was the first time. The varieties of food for the price point is just worth every penny. The taste is good and the menu keeps Changing..We went here for breakfast buffet, the food is good and the service as well. They have a wide variety of breakfast options from Indian, American, continental and healthy options as well. A nice place for a morning breakfast with friends. Over al the best part is that itÇÑs priced perfectly.. itÇÑs not expensive on the pocket for the options they provide."
5,I have visited this hotel. Their food is awesome and ambience is also very good. The best part is the service. Special thanks to Mahi and Kajal.
5,Very good staff really appreciate there work . The restaurant has very good ambiance will visit it again . Thanks Mahi and kajal for ur service .
4,"Nook at Aloft has the best VFM breakfast service on the entire ORR. As you walk in to the restaurant you are greeted with a smile on the face of the staff. I have been here 3 times in the recent past and have never been disappointed.The spread on offer caters to the Indian and Western palate. My only wish was that they also serve bacon. A live omlette bar with healthy options (egg whites only), paratha counter and pancake/waffles really makes the dining experience wholesome. I personally love the bircher muesli on offer along with fresh juices and fruits. I even happened to taste some of the sweetest musk melon on offer, here.For the offer price of 295 all-inclusive one cant really go wrong in opting for breakfast at Nook."
1,So the place has decent food but abysmal service.. itÇÑs so slow that a tortoise would have gone home and come back before the waitress came for the next step... IÇÑm never going back there .
4,"Nice ambiance and good service. Tom kha chicken soup - most preferred for the ones who love thai cuisine. Its a excellent blend of veggies/chicken in coconut milk Laziji chicken - tastes good with taste of wine. But it was lil harder, which could have been made little tender Prawns deep fried was very tasteful. Chicken biryani was little dry, expect that taste was good"
1,Worst food ever had ! That is enough ! Strongly .. I repeat strongly not recommended at at all .. Even the fulkas were below par†•§ ..staff is as good as illiterate.. even the local chai thela would give you a better experience
5,Had non veg thali yesterday and it was one of the best thali I ever had. I don't have high hopes but it turned out awesome.Highly recommended. Ç
3,"The calmness is the best highlight of this place, if you want to sit back relax and enjoy your meal then do head here.Have tried1. Chilli Prawns2. Non Veg Thali1. Chilli PrawnsNot very exciting, felt it was on the oily side and could have been lot better at a fine dine restaurant. The spices and the sauce were perfect though.2. Non Veg ThaliThis was a large meal with loads of variety. Though the chicken gravy was overloaded with spices (garam Masala), this is more like a North Indian Thali with the fish gravy in the Goan style.Could have been better is my opinion.Apologies for no pictures here.Would I Visit Again? Yes to explore more of the food options."
3,"i visited aloft a month back for lunch on the occasion of receiving our first stipend. However our excitement was quite marred by the staff who were the least interested in servicing people who maybe did not look like high profile business professionals. From asking for a table, to water, menu cards and enquiring about food... we had to keep calling the waiters. Anyone in the hospitality industry should have this as a basic requirement.Coming to the food... it was quite tasty when it finally arrived (maybe because we were famished) but it could definitely do way better considering the price they are charging. If not the quality of food... the service should definitely be improved... in the sense that they treat every guest with equal importance.Even though the food was good, I will not be visiting a second time simply because my overall experience was not that great."
5,Nice decor good bar service and good variety of dishes different cocktails by barman new offer on beers n happy hours r gud at aloft I will suggest to all
3,"Decent business hotel, the food quality was average. The amenities provided were reasonable. The meeting hall was wide enough to occupy more than two hundred odd people. There's a pool table, nice and big sofas to sit at the front of the hotel.The Friday night life isn't as you could expect. Since, you wouldn't find not too many coming to a hotel like aloft for a night life. The restaurant has some good varieties of dishes in the menu.To talk about the bar, the drinks are overpriced (just me who can't afford.) I'd rather suggest BYOD."
5,Its the best hidden place all in Marathali. I have been here many times and a time i. Very much delighted. They many things attached more pool game is the best in lobby. Enjoyed!!!
4,"Nook is a nice restaurant with a perfect ambiance. Since it is part of Aloft so no parking issues :-)We ordered Smoked Chickenn mushroom risotto, Fish Morsel, some drinks and Gulab JamunSmoked Chickenn mushroom risotto was very tasty, the sauce was a bit tangy and not too spicy. Fish Morsel was good too. The best part is that the restaurant has a Kids menu too.... not found in a lot of restaurant.Ç Staff was welcoming and the service was quick too.The only con was that Gulab Jamun were a bit hard."
5,Visited this place on Saturday fir breakfast. Huge spread for breakfast at a reasonable price . Staff are very welcoming and helpful. Thanks alot kajal for looking after us will be back
5,Awesome place and awesome food very good serviceby kajal. Very good ambiance It's colourful and vibrant will come back soon and it's highly recommended by me
4,"Great food, huge variety, awesome taste... this place is absolute delight for the vegetarians. Unlike other buffets, this one has more of a vegetarian centric menu. They have good selection of salads, assorted fruits, chaats etc. For starters there doesnÇÑt seem to be too many options. Chicken lovers were disappointed with only 1 chicken starter. There was a live counter as well for fish and shrimps I guess. Main course buffet had good variety with mix of Mughlai, Chinese, Hyderabadi cuisines. Desserts had a good variety from ice creams, pastries, pies etc.Preparations are very delicious as well. Price of buffet is on the higher side though."
5,I was staying at Aloft and hence went there for breakfast. Brilliant food with a lot of choices. I specifically enjoyed the live counter and would highly recommend this place for everyone.
5,I just loved this place. Awesome food and ambiance very vibrant and colourful . service by Kajal was excellent. thanks Kajal. I would ask every one to go and enjoy the buffet
4,"Excellent Dinner Buffet. Wide food variety and tested good. Great service. They served us complimentary welcome drink. Just when we were about to finish, one of them we had interacted earlier few times remembered and came to greet us and offered post dinner Tea / Coffee which he does most of the times. Great place to relax with friend and family."
5,Amazing place Beautiful service & Bar it was great mind blowing experience in the Boffet on food's I love always Cessna Aloft special thanks to Mr.Bharath and Team thank you somuch...Ñè
5,"Value for money restaurant. Good food and good staff. Buffet spread is good for the money they charge.Very flexible with the menu, chefs do their best to match your taste."
5,Good food accomplish with good services.Enjoyed the dining experience.Malabar cuisine food was very much authentic. Service guys are very much proactive enough to fullfil the needs.See you soon.
4,"I was recently invited to experience the ÇThe Taste Of MalabarÇÑ food festival at Nook, my first time at the restaurant. I thoroughly enjoyed my time there, savouring the lovely food that was served to me.The festival was an attempt by Chef Aniket Das (Executive Chef at Nook) to showcase the cuisine of the Mapilla community from the Malabar coastal region. Mapilla ÇÄ also called Moplah ÇÄ is community of Malayalam-speaking Muslims in the Malabar, with a distinct cuisine of their own. I loved how the food festival brought Kerala to life. A little stall was set up to represent the chai kada (tea shop) of Kerala, complete with a variety of chips, bananas hanging off hooks and Malayalam newspapers. Coconut-leaf decorations adorned the ceiling, and most of the food was presented in earthenware utensils that are so typical of Kerala. Another small stall handed out tender coconut water to the guests who requested them. An exhibit showcased a few ingredients that are indigenous to Kerala ÇÄ coconuts and red rice and red bananas. The front office staff were dressed the Kerala way too, with golden-bordered kasavus, white shirts, mundus and veshtis.The food festival menu is in addition to the regular buffet at Nook, at no additional charge. A walk around the buffet showed me that it was quite, quite expansive, spanning a vast variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. I really mean it ÇÄ the spread here is HUGE.A live fish fry counter that had been set up for the food festival elicited sighs of pleasure from my fellow diners. I sampled only the vegetarian fare, of course.As we settled into our seats, little pots of Kerala delicacies were brought to us to munch on ÇÄ assorted chutneys, poppadums, rose cookies, tapioca chips, sweet and savoury banana chips, and jackfruit chips. Every bit of this was thoroughly enjoyed by yours truly, especially the lip-smackingly gorgeous pumpkin, curry leaf and raw mango chutneys.Next up, I tried out the somasi ÇÄ wheat flour shells stuffed with different types of fillings and then deep-fried. I loved the two vegetarian versions, with paneer and mushroom stuffing within.The onion samosa that I sampled alongside was also beautiful, crisp and perfectly done, the filling delicious.I understand, from my non-vegetarian fellow diners, that the somasi with chicken and beef filling was exquisite too. The stir-fried squid and chicken was, apparently, very well done as well.The buffet also included three drinks (if I may call them so!) that are integral to Kerala ÇÄ neer more or mildly spiced buttermilk, cumin-flavoured water, and water that is infused with a herb called pathimugam or sappanwood.I chose some salads from the regular buffet to sample, next. I must say I absolutely loved the salad counter at Nook, it is so very expansive, with several types of vegetarian and non-vegetarian versions available. There are different types of chaats on offer at the counter as well.I loved the Capsicum Salad here, with a sweetish dressing, served with bits of feta. The Jackfruit Salad (yes, you read that right! Nowhere else have I come across a salad like this!) was a close second favourite. The Ripe Fig Salad was good too, as was the Soya Nuggets Chaat (the latter, again, something I have never come across before).For main course, I tried out the Kerala Red Rice with Ulli Theeyal, a tamarind-based preparation with shallots. While I loved the earthy taste of the red rice, I felt the ulli theeyal could have done with a bit more flavour. The Cabbage Mezhukkuperatti or stir fry that I sampled alongside was very well done, too, mild and simple, yet full of deliciousness.I also tried out the Vegetarian Pizza, Singapore Noodles and Hot-And-Sour Vegetables from the regular buffet, which I felt were just about okay. I loved the Paneer & Papad Sabzi I sampled from the buffet, too (Just how innovative that is, right?!)As per my fellow non-vegetarian diners, the Mapilla Chicken Biryani was out of the world, and the appams with chicken stew were fantabulous too. I didnÇÑt have space enough in my tummy to try out the vegetarian versions. The sheer variety of pickles that was part of the buffet ÇÄ from chicken and prawn pickle to lal mirch ka achaar and mixed vegetable pickle ÇÄ was mind-boggling!The dessert counter at Nook is vast, just like the salad bar, including stuff for every kind of sweet tooth there is. Thanks to the food festival, the dessert counter had typical Kerala sweet dishes like buckwheat halwa, Calicut halwa and Vattayappam (sweet steamed rice cakes made with toddy). This was apart from the regular sweet dishes like ice cream, pannacotta, mousse and various Indian desserts.I was able to try out very few of the desserts, of which I adored the chocolate gateau and the buckwheat halwa. The vattayappam, basboosa and mango-ginger mousse were so intriguing that I had to pick them up but, sadly, they did not hit the right taste notes with me.A few of the dishes I tried out from the regular buffet were just okay, while the others were beautiful and par excellence. That said, the buffet menu changes regularly, so the items (and taste) I encountered might not be the case with you, when you visit.Considering that Mapilla cuisine is predominantly non-vegetarian, options for vegetarians are relatively limited on the food festival menu. However, the regular buffet more than makes up for it.The buffet is definitely value for money (Rs. 1099 + taxes per head), with or without the food festival, considering the huge spread. I donÇÑt think I can try out all the items at one go, even if I tried to."
5,Great food selection and service.... highly recommended place to dine with your friends and family..... especial thanks to Marissa for suprising my mom with a birthday cake on special occasion.... Thank you so much will come soon.
3,We came here for team lunch. Ambience and service was good. It was crowded but spacious. A lot of options for dessert and salads. Was not much happy with the starters and main course. The taste was okayish for some items and some items were tasteless. I would give 3/5 for food.
5,Food was very nice kajal was grt at her service will come back soon had a great time dinning here service vas excelent !!!! would recomend ut everyone !!!
3,"Been here a few times and Everytime was good experience. The latest visit though was disappointing- average starters, chicken not so tender, fish was good. Dessert selection was good but won't make much of a deal unless accompanied by decent main course. The one positive side is service which was exceptional."
5,"went for team lunch during weekdays , opted for buffet. Very nice spread of starters, pizza, main course ... food is good and staff are very courteous"
3,"We went there for a team lunch, look and feel was good, ambiance is also good. Service was so-so, nothing special. Now let's talk about food, food was pretty average, lots of variety for Non-veg, but none of them was good. I tried chicken, fish, and mutton, none of them well cooked, the chicken was not tender at all. Desert was good, there was nothing else to mention about."
5,"We have been there a couple of time for Weekend dinner as well as office lunches. This place has a beautiful ambience, delicious Indian and continental food and it is located in the heart of Bengaluru. TheÇ Service was really quick and the staff was really well behaved. A perfect place for a couple as well as a bunch of friends."
3,"Been here several times simply bcoz itÇÑs in the same business park where I work. Food: average especially for vegetarians as the variety in the buffet is usually less. Desserts can be exotic (but may not always be yummy like with a matcha cake that I tried) Given the price point, I think there are better places that you can choose in the neighbourhood"
5,Amazing place which has beautiful bar and Cessna and a bar it was a mind blowing experience in the buffet on the grill and eat day with a lot of bloggers
4,"Recently been there for their Roast and Grill food festival, one could feel the roast and grill in air, the food was too good with good range of starters, main course and desserts."
4,"As the festive fever and marathon of food continued through Christmas ,New Year & Poush Parbon , i was happy to be part of a Food festival which was slightly different .This one celebrated and served Roasts n Grills. Many different kinds of meat and lots of sea food options which included fish,shrimp, scallop,squids, mussels."
1,I came with my friend at night to have some food but that time no one was there in restaurant . After 10 to 15 minutes one guy came then he took the order for chicken biriyani and served biriyani after 50 minutes. And there was no accompaniment with biriyani.Service of staff was not professional behaviour of staff was also not in a professional manner and it feel like staffs are not treated as professional.
4,"ÇìI love the culture of grilling. It creates an atmosphere that is festive but casual.Çù ÇÄBobby FlayAloft CBP is well known for their unparalleled food festivals across the calendar. Recently, Nook hosted A Roast and Grill food festival like no other and we were cordially invited to relish the meats and veggies at their finest as they were roasted and grilled to perfection.There were never-ending options in both Vegetarian and Non vegetarian dishes which were Starters, Main course as well as desserts."
5,Kamal is a great server we went at morning 4 am and he treat us like a family keep it up Kamal we will come for u only ...love Aloft great job ....
3,"First thing is location , if you are working in Bellandur it's good choiceÇ with reasonable price.Ç I had been there twice withÇ team and chose this place due to location, but happy to do that.Ç It's not very big space but decor is done nicely with modern theme. On entrance you have pool tableÇ , which my younger team mates found moreÇ interesting.Ç Front desk staff were courteous and escorted me to the booked table of our choice , few advantages you get for early dinner on a weekdays. After seeing their spread we settled for Buffet, as with Dine out membership discount, that seemed a steal.Ç Buffet has wide spared in each course of meals from Starters to desserts. Salad section was also good andÇ Biryani was awesome and must here , in dessertÇ you should not missÇ Rum cake. Service was good and they help us with hot coffee also post our dinner."
4,"I visited Nook as part of a bloggers meet to witness their Roast and Grill festival that will go on until 25th Jan at 1100+ taxes.I was amazed at the spread and variety of food. The whole roasted red snapper, mutton kebabs, chicken starters and some other roasted veggies and non veg food were pretty good.Biryani as usual was good.Various kinds of starters for both veg and non-veg were pretty good too. Desserts were nice but I would've loved to see some more that could relate to roast and grill.But keep your eyes open as ALOFT keeps coming up with various food festivals and their normal buffet spread is pretty good too.There are pretty good cocktails as said by my drunkard friends. If this excites you, just go try and the spread is huge and there's always something for everyone as per their liking!"
4,"Wonderful and tasty buffet spread. The grills were out of the world and the deserts options were many, and unfortunately I couldn't taste all of them :) Nice ambiance, seating and there's even a pool table to chill out a while."
4,Lunch buffet was really good... It had different varieties of dishes... Especially the dessert section... Which to me is one of the important thing in a buffet and they have done justice to it
5,"Superb awesome hotel....Was here with family and friends for a sunday morning breakfast...Love the buffet spread...Almost everything there...Friendly and courteous staff...Various options in food from continental to north Indian puri and parathas and of course south Indian idli dosa...Great food , superb taste...A must to plan visit for your breakfast outing with family...Worth the money spent...Do try the ginger tea it's great...All thank to Mr. Mahendar for his friendly service..."
4,"Looking for luxurious dining, this place is the solution. I must say for the first time I observed such a pocket friendly place with 5 star services. They have many options available from Thali to finger food. You will have a great experience with respect to hospitality. You can play games there likes snooker and foosball. I had a great experience with my friends. It's a good choice to go out with family and friends"
5,"Went on a team dinner at this amazing place, live band , amazing decor and courteous staff . Took the buffet which had variety of salads, deserts and main course. Starters were good, garlic noodles were awesome. A good experience overall."
3,I visited there and found ambiance was too good. There were lots of salad items and starters available. Options are more but taste was normal or below average. Cakes were hard to eat and ice-cream were normal ice cream. Moong daal halwa was just okay. Malpua with rabari was good.
3,"NOOK is a typical example of a high end restaurant which is high on quantity and low on quality. They charge about 1275 per head for a buffet lunch and also serve alcohol. Located at the lobby of ALOFT hotel , this restaurant has colourful interiors. The seating is comfortable and the interiors make it look lively. The staff is courteous and are generally available when you need some thing. The way the food was presented was also pleasing.The salad section is huuuuuuuge... They have innumerable options and many are pretty good. You can have a good meal with just the starters. The non veg section was funny actually. They had 4 non veg salads and all of them were chicken based :-)The starters had both chicken and fish options. Except fried basa fish, others were pretty average. It was the same with veg starters as well. Except for bhajji, rest all were average.The main course had quite a bit of options. But the items were either oily or tasted ok ok. The biryani was bland and the mutton tasted a bit old. The veg options looked better than non veg.The desserts had some 15 -20 options but none of them are worth mentioning except malpua and chocolate pudding. The rasgulla was sour, cakes were hard and the ice creams were pretty ordinary. You can easily give a miss to the dessert section even though it looks to offer a lot of variety.On the whole, they need to work a lot on the quality of the dishes . Having so many options do not make sense if many of them taste average. I would go with a 3 out of 5 for this place. You can visit it only if you are nearby."
4,"Went there for team lunch. The buffet was scrumptious and wide range of dishes. The salads were really deleicious, paprika chat was awesome . The starters and soup were not that appetizing. All in all a place worth trying."
4,"Nice place, good food, excellent service. Value for money. Staffs are polite and friendly. But no live counter as now days all the buffet restaurant have. I liked their hospitality."
3,Had lunch buffet here. Lots of variety is present in both veg and non veg. Starter were really good. N deserts were out of the world. Never had this extensive dessert option in buffet. Ambience is good and staff are polite. Overall it was a good experience.
4,"Aloft Cessna Business Park has become a second home to me mainly because they are probably one of the few hotels which take an extra effort to try out different cuisine inspite of having excellent location and great crowd.Ç Food festivals need to showcase not only different country cuisines but in certain cases like this one, dishes from Afghani to Awadhi which is loved world over ÇÄ KEBABS & BIRYANI."
5,"The entrance to Nook was embellished with a wide assortment of spices, dry fruits/nuts and other exotic ingredients that go into their culinary creations.Ç I walked back to the corridor a couple of times for the rich aroma ÇÇ.I am a big kebab/ biryani fan. Their 'Kebabs and Biryani fiesta'Ç is ON till 22nd Sept and I wouldnt miss out on such an opportunity.Presentation was creative and immaculate.Ç Imagine plating on granite slabs, concrete slabsÇ and mini smoke pedestals just to name a few Äòç.***Appetizers ***Potato balls - Presented on a mini stove shaped base. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside . Enjoyed with the sauces that came along.Cheesy roll - Ultra light flavours andÇ international look/taste ÄòçÄòç. We took multiple servings of these !!Mushroom ki galoti was served on a sizzler pan and was the best in a long long time . I would eat more but for saving tummy space for mains and desserts ÇÇBeetroot cutlet - fried oval shaped cutlets which felt like ' taste bhi, health bhi' ÇCranberry twister was the only drink I tried. Was refreshing but I should have asked for less Ice as towards the end it was only cold water. I must go slow or ask for less Ice..Ç Can't blame anyone Ä***Mains***10 varieties of Biryanis on one table is a paradise for a Biryani lover. 5 of them were vegetarian(and egg) , so digged into each one .Lucknowi chaman biryani - succulent generous portions of paneer and other veggies in aromatic rice. Spicy and flavourful to my liking.The raitas were very interesting ... Anar Dana raita, cucumber raita , pineapple raita in addition to the typical onion raita.Nawabi subz biryani - Was a tad different than the typical biryanis in Hyderabad. Not even sure if this was intended to be hyderabadi style. Nevertheless, delectable and rich.Malli Valakayi (raw banana) biriyani - A variety that I saw for the first time. It may be an acquired taste ÑÄû, so didn't go beyond a few bites . And... I also had to try a lot more stuff on offer.Paneer dum biriyani - TheÇ pot was served hot at the table with dum. Succulent , heavenly chunks of paneer made this Biryani my favouriteÄòçÄòç for the day. I almost finished an entire portion !!Mutte(egg) biriyani - Fried whole eggs in a very local (guess Tamil nadu) style. Very spicy and IÇ can take that level, so enjoyed it.*** Desserts ***The choco peanut bar was like a glorious snicker on the outside and a flavourful but light biscot/cake inside . Had 3 of these!!!The Indian desserts : gajar halwa, gulab jamoon, shahi tukda, kaccha gulla all looked tempting. Skipped due to lack of space in belly.Ice creams + toppings were standard . Created a dessert adding Pineapple tart , ice cream , choco sauce and nuts. It was gooood!!!My meat eating buddies loved the sheek kebab, raan and other mains. They were all going gaga, so appears the non-veg sections were also great .If you are a Biryani/kebab fan , this festival is a must visit !!!***Summary scores ***Taste/QualityÇ - 4.5/5Value for money - 4.5/5Portion size - 4.5/5Ambience/Service - 4.5/5 - with Mohamed Owais Adam and Rohini James (rjheartnsoul)"
3,Amazing Ambiance.Comfortable sofas for seating. Beautiful lighting and decoration.Ç Various kinds of starters specially chaat forms.Quality was averageGood ServiceHappy eating!
3,Had been to this place for a team dinner. Really good ambiance and value for money. Chats & Main course were the highlight while starters & deserts could've been better.
3,"I have been to this place earlier multiple times for buffet for office parties.The regular buffet is a decent spread. It is exquisite when they have special buffets like fish festival etc. First time we tried Alacarte, which I felt okay experience. We have ordered sticky chicken and fish fry. I felt fish fry should have given some crunching bites, however it was soggy. The spicy chicken was deep over fried which made bit hard to chew. Overall alacarte experience is ok ok. Prefer going for buffet. The overall ambience is similar to any other business hotel."
4,"I have been to aloft CBP several times: sometimes for office parties, sometimes for reviews etc. I really love the food they serve and the food festivals at Nook. I have been there for quite a few festivals : Cuisines of the coast, American food festival, Bohri food festival and a middle eastern food festival as well.Each time, there were some exquisite preparations which were absolutely lip smacking! The regular buffet has a wide spread of items: both veg and non veg including grilled Basa, sautÉ©ed mushrooms, drunken chicken, veg pizza and many more.The main course mainly consists of Biryani, paneer, chicken, fish and mutton preparations. The festival specialties depend from festival to festival but never disappoint.Recently, I experienced a giant burger and pizza and a grilled chicken with Nutella. Very different food at very attractive prices. The best of the best from my side would be their Kebab platter which they served during their Bohri food festival.Amazing! I definitely recommend a visit.That's all from my side.Priyanjana (The Foodie Land Blog) "
4,Great ambience and amazingly huge buffet spread. Food was delicious and the staff was very attentive to everyone of us. Definitely worth multiple visits.

This is a not-to-be-missed food festival as they have all sorts of grilled dishes in the menu, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. For a food lover, itÇÑs a delight to be attend this food festival.

There is a Bohri food festival going on at Aloft from 12th June till 23rd June. Although, I heard a lot about the Bohri cuisine but never got a chance to taste the authentic Bohri food.

4,"Take the Spice Route from the best of Bohri cuisine meets earthy essence of GujaratKeeping up with their monthly food festival, Aloft Bengaluru Cessna Business Park came up with this much sort after fest providing a menu of 'Bohri Cuisine' which is much sort after among the meat eaters.I remember, few of my friends asking me for recommendation to try Bohri dishes in Namma Bengaluru With the roots from Yemen, having influence of Arabic, middle eastern cuisine & Gujarat(after few Bohra's settled there), this Cuisine is all about Kebabs & Tikkas, minimal spices & usage of chicken, mutton & fish.Keeping up with Tradition of 'Family who eats together, stays together', all the family members eats in one large plate called as 'Thaal'Indulge in Non-Veg & Veg Platters, delectable Desserts & lip-smacking gravies till 23rd June (during weekdays lunch or dinner buffet) & pair the subtle spiced food with their ongoing mango cocktails only at Aloft Bengaluru .Pricing - 1099 excluding taxes "
4,"I had come here for a corporate lunch. Firstly the service was excellent. The ambience was also up to the mark. There was a chana dal soup which was interesting taste! The starters were not up the mark. Pizza was cold. The main course was good. The standard you can expect at most of such restaurants. The naan were piping hot. The desserts were mostly with egg. The few without eggs were decent. Overall not bad, but can definitely improve in the variety and increasing the vegetarian dishes."
1,I was there today for a meeting.The location is a good choice with warm ambience and courteous staff.Since I was there for a business meeting I went to the business centre.Here is the catch. To my horror the table was in cleaned with about three or four empty crushed bottles. They had also not cleared the take away mug from the table. While the meeting began I requested for a regular tea. I was served which was diluted and with added sugar with out the customer request.There was also some cookies lying on the table which I accidentally consumed and realised to my horror that the cookies must have been lying there for some days as it had become very soft.I feel the management has to look into these small requirements as they are based in a business tech park.

5,"We went for client meeting and it was perfectRight from ambience , service , food and overall experience. We were tired after day long meetings and came down to aloft in order to unwind . There was an option of buffet but we didn't went with that : plainly because we were tired and we left to sous chef :- Mr Murthy to delight us . Right from starters , drinks , bar nibbles , main course and dessert was his recommendation . We loved it !Great job to team and special thanks to Mr Murthy !"
4,"I realized, that it was the passion of reinventing, the excitement of making people try something new and the exuberance of receiving praise for your effort that drives the Festival."

4,I was invited to try out the dishes from the Kashmiri food fest and it was a revelation. Ç Before I get into the food lets talk about the decor. Ç Aloft is a very classy hotel by itself with its avant garde interiors that makes is look nice and posh. This classy interior was given a good kashmiri decor for the fest with the different local and traditional spices and vegetables kept on display.

4,"Yummy buffet breakfast, wide spread and lots of sections with different cuisines. If you're a brunch or breakfast person and would like to eat till your tummy die in the morning, do visit."
4,been here for a light breakfast and loved it. Lots of options in the breakfast and also good variety juices to relish a healthy breakfast. Found they also have bar might visit again for the dinner
4,"Not a whole range of veg starters, Great varieties for the non veg bunch though. They do have live counters for pasta but no pizza served. The salads and soup is the regular affair.The big plus is the dessert menu have a really wide variety of Indian and international sweets.The Italian served is good enjoyed the au gratin. Love their baked cheese cakes and crÉ®me brulÉ©."
2,Ambience is the only good factor here... Food is average... Had been with a team and all were disappointed... Do not recommend this hotel to any one... Also felt very pricy for the quality of the food served..

Bright vibrant colors with soothing citrus aroma.Ç Nook has a wonderful cozy ambiance and kid friendly restaurant. Buffet spread was amazing and ample options to choose from. Food was good if not great and could have been more tastier. I wish they had more options of non-veg gravy. For the experience offered, price was reasonable.Ç What floored me was the service. I wish I can give them 6/5 on service. Outstanding. They ensued that we are comfortable with 2 small kids. They even gave us customized cutlery of Barbie and Chhota Bheem theme for the kids. Wow! There were people constantly monitoring to ensure all the tantrums of kids are taken care of. What else does a parent Ç want :)"
4,"The buffet in this hotel is exquisite. Your tummy will fill just by looking at the variety of dishes. Be it breakfast,lunch or dinner the quality of food is superb!! Even the ala-carte has a number of options to choose from. This place is a good example of fine dining plus good hospitality."
4,"Visited here for lunch with office colleagues and we have enjoyed with delicious food. Both the veg & non veg, starters and dessert items are too good.Ç We liked grilled chicken and grilled sea foods.Ç The people are very respective. Don't miss to taste food here."
4,"I tried buffet here once but it wasn't that great. Recently I went again and ordered a few non veg dishes as buffet was off the list. To my surprise, all of it was very good this time. The service guy took good care of all us and was very much concerned if we liked the food or not. Overall it was a good experience."
3,"Had gone to this place for team lunch.The ambiance of the place is awesome. The service is good. And the food here is nice. We had buffet over here. Of all the items I liked the fish over here, which was very tender and delicious.Ç The only one suggestion which I want to give is that they should increase their variety, which I found was less as compared to other restaurants.Overall had a nice experience today."
4,"Bangalore has been an epicenter of the South for several global cuisines and tje city's Mexican food could be ranked among the best in the country (or at least in South India). While there are several standalone restaurants that have been doing a great job in bringing these cuisines to our city, the five star hotels have followed a different strategy and have religiously hosted food festivals to offer these global delicacies to us."
3,"We went to Nook for Team lunch. First thing wat caught our attention was the ambience. It was well decorated and refreshing in terms of style. Now comes the main part, the Food, Overall It was satisfactory. Good variety and taste. Few items were cold and were not up to the mark. Menu had Appam and veg/non-veg stew which was rare to find in any typical buffet. Desert section also had lot of varieties but again nothing great."
4,"Went here for team dinner. Ambience is really nice. Staff is extremely friendly and helpful. Coming down to the food, the buffet has a lot of variety. Especially if you a strict vegetarian, you will get a lot of options here. Taste is also decent. Desert section too had a lot of items (eggless too)."
3,"Was here as part of team lunch from office.The ambience is eye-catching.Ç The buffet is regular except that it had a wide range of salads.The menu is elaborate.Don't try the chaats section - very mediocre.Starters - Tawa fish, Vegetable nuggets, Pesto marinated potato, Pasta in tomato basil sauce and grilled veggies were yummyyyy.Main courseVery few dishes that i liked in the main course. Chilli oats crusted fish was soft and tasted amazing.Dal makhani, Bhindi Tamatar and coconut rice was decent.The chicken in the biriyani was bland, and the mutton not tender at all.I did not eat the Thai or Chinese food, so no comments on that.DessertsNothing incredible but enjoyed Dark chocolate pastry, Sabudana kheer, Coffee caramel brÉªlÉ©e, milk chocolate pawa, and yoghurt (i don't remember the name).Mango cake was okayish. The french assorted cakes, carrot cake, apple jelousie - all very dry and didn't seem fresh.The mini cakes were distastefulService:I asked for roti and was served Naan.The staff was always in a hurry to clean the table.I filled two plates, kept it on my table and went back to get more as i don't like walking back and forth while having a meal.When i was back with some more food, both plates were missing.I was so miffed.How can they remove plates filled with food!!!.It costs around Rs.1500 per head.It wasn't a satisfying experience.One time visit."
3,A nice place to dine with friend and family . Only thing is that if you are going for Al-Carte then you have to wait long . Mocktails that we ordered was not freshly made and taste like canned drink. They took 60 mins to serve our starters and 30 mins for main course. I think they are busy with buffet. Even for serving desserts they took 20 mins . Quality and quantity of food was good. Very less option for vegetarians . Cost is very high which doesn't satisfy the taste and quantity of food.
4,"This being my first visit to Nook, from the exterior look, my initial impression was that it is a modern (slightly serious) restaurant set up in a business hotel, with a news ticker running some quirky facts on one of the walls. When we walked inside the restaurant, my perception altered slightly- it is a fun setting with large modern chandeliers lighting up the restaurant. Within a few minutes of being there, I couldn't help notice the dominant green theme in the restaurant, the seating and some walls painted in color green which is pleasing to the eye, with hints of grey and white. The buffet spread is great with a wide selection of Indian and continental veg n non-veg fare. Some of the things which caught my attention are falafel bullets, spicy rolls and salad bar. There was a great choice of gravies both veg n non veg.For Desserts gajarka halwa, Tiramasu n pinna cota were the highlight. Service is good for buffet place.Definitely a great option for office parties."
4,"The spread on nook is excellent. The choices of the buffet keeps changing regularly.The taste is good too.I came for the kerala festival and the choices was extensive.I would highly recommend to try nook with family for the moneys worth.The dessert was also excellent , in taste and choice."
4,"Been to this place several time but it was to the Bar, This time we have booked The Nook for the team dinner. The first impression is really amazing setup and nice choreography done, u can say it's a fusion of bar cum amazing restaurant. Dim lights decorated walls ceiling with nice lighting and great dining tables.Now let's discuss the starter, main course, drinks and dessert. OMG I have never seen so many varieties being offered in any restaurant till date. It's count less, varieties of salads, chat and chatpata snacks, starters, main course, fruits, ice creams, sweets and lot more. Pictures will tell you more please have a look.Service and management response is really appreciable. They have taken care of each n every requirements of ours.Thanks Nook"
4,"It is one of the best option to eat for inhouse guest. The food is tasty and staff is friendly , it is decently priced. I had breakfast , lunch and dinners - all were fine. My recommendation would be to go for buffet instead of a la carte. Ç Its is value for money."
4,The buffet has lot of variety! I have tried their al-carte really liked steak nice sauce and cranberry well prepared and tender meat. The other dishes fish based was also really nice prawns and malabar fish curry was mouth watering!
4,"It's a standard business hotel restaurant located in Cessna Business Park. I wouldn't come here if it wasn't in my office campus. There is nothing special about it in terms of the food or the ambience.That said, it is good for business lunches as the buffet offers good variety, the place is never crowded, the staff doesn't get in the way of conversations.Ç The desserts are a particular highlight and something to look forward to if you're having the buffet.Ç Visit it for the occasional lunch if you work in or around Cessna Business Park."
4,"Aloft is a sassy business hotel. TheyÇÑve got 2 properties in Bangalore and I was invited to the one in the Cessna Business park, to dine at the chefÇÑs table during their ongoing Mexican food festival!. It was a lazy Wednesday evening and this event was just what I needed to brighten things up! I work very close to this tech park, so the commute on a weekday wasnÇÑt quite a problem for me. If youÇÑre wondering where this exactly is, itÇÑs about 1km away from the Sakra World hospital."

I work very close to this tech park, so the commute on a weekday wasnÇÑt quite a problem for me. If youÇÑre wondering where this exactly is, itÇÑs about 1km away from the Sakra World hospital.The decor is very urban and they like to give their staff the freedom to express themselves, with emphasis on being ÇcoolÇÑ:)There is a live performance and an active social scene here. I actually enjoyed the music while I was waiting for my friends, in the lobby.Nook, is AloftÇÑs all day dining, multi-cuisine restaurant. This is where we headed to, to try out their Mexican fare!!The table that was reserved for us was well lit, which is a top requirement from food bloggers, when theyÇÑre invited to such events!! This helps in clicking good pictures:)When it comes to Mexican food, all weÇÑve heard of and/or tried is the establishment named Taco BellÇ©. We have been introduced to Nachos, Tacos and Quesadillas!I was looking forward to what Nook,Aloft had to offer:)FOODNachos:No party happens without a bowl of Nachos and salsa dip! We kicked off the evening with just that! What was good to see was, multiple dips, apart from the regular guacamole, sour cream and tomato salsa. The other dips were : Gemada salsa, Salsa Rojo, Mango salsa and Pica de Gallo. When IÇÑm given a lot of choices, I definitely savor the moment!Frijole :This dish not only looked good, but tasted good as well!Frijoles are beans, in Mexican cooking.Ceviche de Camaron :Ceviche is a classic raw fish dish. But, in Mexico, they tend to replace the fish with fresh off-the-boat shrimps! I remember having the Ceviche at Wareabouts Bar & grill earlier, so this dish was definitely familiar.The shrimp is marinated in lime juice for long enough to give it a nice cooked texture. The taste was very good and the dish was very refreshing thanks to the salad!Bean Tostadas :Tostada, in Spanish means toasted. In Mexico and other South American countries, tostadas are used as a base for most bite sized snacks.The filling in the tostadas was corn and beans, with just a bit of melted cheese. This was served with salsa. We felt that the preparation was pretty dry in itself!Ensalada Espinaca Y Aguacate :This was a salad with Spinach, fresh mangoes, avocado, radish and tomatoes. I personally have salads for dinner almost every day. So, I wasnÇÑt very keen on this one. I quickly wolfed down, two very likable items on the plate; mangoes and avocado! The rest of greens were skipped, it felt a bit too healthy for my likingÄQuesadilla :Quesadilla is a corn/wheat tortilla filled with cheese, savory mix(veg/non-veg), wrapped in a nice triangular form to help in gobbling them down easily!We had both vegetarian and non vegetarian options. The vegetarian one was having a slightly crispier crust compared to the non-vegetarian option. This may well be attributed to the difference in the dough used to prepare them. I loved the chicken Quesadilla, which had just the most amazing balance in the mix. The chicken tasted very good as well. Every single bite that I had, I could feel the power packed flavors of the savory mix.This was by far the best dish for me!! Now that IÇÑve mentioned the best dish of the day, donÇÑt be lazy, go through the rest of the items that I have listed, please:)Tacos :Taco is a traditional Mexican dish , with the shell made of corn(usually) or wheat(less common) , folded at the center. YouÇÑd fill them up with a bean or a chicken savory mix along with salsa, guacamole, cilantro, tomatoes, chilly and lettuce. YouÇÑd usually have them in either the crunchy shell or the soft shell.We were given a chicken taco with a crunchy shell. I thought that the dish could not do what the quesadilla did with the balance of flavors. Also, I found the mix very dry and not appetizing at all. For their standards, it was not right up there:)Chicken breast with Mole sauce :When this dish was presented to us, I was spellbound! It was so beautifully plated and I just couldnÇÑt believe how lucky I was to have the chance to taste such a creation:) Now, for those of you who donÇÑt know, a chicken steak is my most favorite savory dish, so I was really excited to try this out.What was interesting in this, however, was that the mole sauce used is a chocolate based sauce, which I had only seen in these Masterchef series, but never had the chance to try it! The sauce I learn contains pine nuts, chocolate, onions, cinnamon, almonds and sesame seeds. I was quite anxious to dig in. The very first bite of this, I found that the taste was polar opposite to the pepper sauce that I usually have my steak with!I would frankly say that my taste buds arenÇÑt used to having this, but upon speaking to the chef, he said it takes a bit of getting used to, in order to like this sauce! I think this dish truly deserves to be the stand out preset main course dish, for the evening! IÇÑm hoping that I get to try this out again:)Tamale Ranchero :This was another beautifully presented dish. Tamale is a Central American dish which is made with starchy dough, usually made of corn. The dough is then steamed in a corn husk. The filling was however something that was purely vegetarian. I did manage to grab a bit out of my friendÇÑs plate! I thought the dish was pretty average in terms of the taste.Desserts :There were 2 desserts that were served to our table. One was churros with 3 different flavors and 2 dips. The other was Tres Leches.Churros :I would frankly tell you that I had never had the chance to have a churro, earlier. This was definitely something that looks pretty colorful. In preparation, this is similar to how a doughnut would be prepared. This would fall under fried dough category!!Churros are fried until they become crunchy, and then sprinkled with sugar. The surface of a churro is ridged with a star-shaped nozzle.We tried three different flavors, one of which was quite bad. The dips were mango and chocolate. This was a pleasant experience for me to have the churros for the first time:)Tres Leches :Tres Leches is a butter cake which is soaked in 3 kinds of milk; evaporated, condensed and cream. The dish tasted absolutely amazing because of the milk part of it and I couldnÇÑt help but reach out for a second serving of it! The cake was very soft and the sugar balance was very good. I loved this dessert!Service & hospitality :I would like to thank Executive Sous Chef Sandeep Kumar, who is a seasoned chef with a vast experience in the hospitality industry, for taking time to give us company, through the entire duration of our dinner. He gave us a lot of valuable insights into how the food is prepared and the kind of standards and processes they follow at Aloft. He was happily sipping a few mugs of tea, while we were having the lovely food. The menu was crafted by Chef Sandeep, but was executed to the ÇTÇÑ by Chef Murli:) The service staff was extremely courteous and attended to our every need. They did a fantastic job at serving us the food and giving us the right amount of gap between dishes!I had a great dining experience and would love to come back here to try the regular fare at Nook. I wouldnÇÑt change a thing, I believe the menu was very well conceptualized and executed:)I would also come up with a separate blog post for the different spirits we had on the same day!!That would be tagged under their WXYX Bar:) Watch out for that!"
4,"General View:While I have been here as part of two blogger meets, love this place for its quality food. amazing cocktails and infused vodkas and super friendly, hospitable and knowledgeable staff. Both visits were great experiences and it is a place I would love to revisit. Review of Mexican food fest:Bangalore has been an epicenter of the South for several global cuisines and tje city's Mexican food could be ranked among the best in the country (or at least in South India). While there are several standalone restaurants that have been doing a great job in bringing these cuisines to our city, the five star hotels have followed a different strategy and have religiously hosted food festivals to offer these global delicacies to us. I was invited with a few fellow food bloggers for a preview of the Mexican food festival at Aloft - Cessna Business Park. The festival is on till April 22, 2016. Pricing The promotional menu is priced at INR. 1099 and each add on cocktail could be bought at INR.199 (both of these priced are excluding taxes). Drinks They offer five margarita flavours (Cinnamon, Watermelon, Hazelnut, Tamarind, Cucumber and Pineapple) along with the buffet for this food festival. With tequila being the base liquor - these cocktails are perfect summer coolers if you are looking to beat the recent heat wave in the city.FoodHighlighting the key dishes from the menu:1. Nachos with dips - While we love our nachos with regular salsa or Guacamole, one gets to try a few more adaptations and variants of these dips with their nachos here. They offer the following five dips for nachos:- Pica De Gallo- Guacamole - Mango Salsa- Salsa Roja- Gemada Salsa 2. Tacos - With fresh and crunchy taco shells, the chicken tacos was filled with tender and succulent chicken chunks, black beans and veggies. They also offer a vegetarian substitute for the non meat eaters3. Quesadilla -Again chicken and vegetarion options; the chicken quesadilla was outstanding and is probably among the better quesadillas I have had. 4. Ceviche de camaron - I would have refused to eat raw prawns if not for the description given by the chef. In this dish, prawns marinated in lime for over 16 hours is served with corn, sliced tomatoes, olives and jalapenos. This salad styled offering was a perfect melody of flavours and had a great balance to it.5. Ensalada Espinaca Y AguacateA fresh salad with fresh and green spinach, mangoes, avocado, radish and cilantro-olive oil dressing. 6. Chicken Mole - Chicken breast topped with chocolate sauceIt was my second attempt at mole and I found it more compatible to my taste preference this time around. Unless you have already tried mole's before - it is a dish you might struggle to appreciate.Desserts They had two mexican desserts:1.Tres leches - this was decent, but I must concede that I have had better. 2. Flavoured churros with mango and chocolate dips - found this to be a little off; probably the better churro experiences I have had at other places is the reason.While the promo menu has enough items to meet your hunger needs, you could also try items from the regular buffet spread if you are dining as a part of this offer."
4,"This feedback is based on my experience trying out an elaborate Mexican meal during the Mexican food fest at Nook, Restaurant in Aloft Hotel with few other foodie friends. The review is quite elaborate too :) This being my first visit to Nook, from the exterior look, my initial impression was that it is a modern (slightly serious) restaurant set up in a business hotel, with a news ticker running some quirky facts on one of the walls. When we walked inside the restaurant, my perception altered slightly- it is a fun setting with large modern chandeliers lighting up the restaurant. Within a few minutes of being there, I couldn't help notice the dominant green theme in the restaurant, the seating and some walls painted in color green which is pleasing to the eye, with hints of grey and white. The sofa seating across the restaurant is comfortable.We started off trying a selection of infused vodka displayed at the entrance of the restaurant, by the bar counter. There were about 15 different infused Vodka available to try. The infused vodka idea is a brainchild of the Food and Beverage manager of Aloft, Saurabh Thakur. Some of the vodka infused options we tried were - Galangal, Rose infused, Black cardamom, Basil, Orange and lime, White tea raspberry, Rosemary, Coffee, Star arise and Rose in bloom. These flavours were seperately inflused in neat-vodka, the flavours are allowed to infuse in the bottles for a minimum of 5-7 days. The infused vodka options are definitely offbeat, a must try for all the vodka lovers. Although I tried a sip of the listed infused vodkas (there were a few more we couldn't try). My favourites were: Galangal, white tea raspberry and Orange and Lime, in that order. - Galangal had woody flavour with a tinge of ginger taste.- White Tea and Raspberry - I being a sucker for tea, this fruit infused white tea raspberry flavour hit the right note for me- Orange and lime - During summer, the citrusy flavours did the tricks on me. What followed next were a few options of their signature Margaritas, each of them served in a cocktail glass and different look. Out of all the options we tried i.e. Tamarind, Pineapple upside down, cucumber and mint, watermelon, cinnamon, and hazelnut, I loved the Pineapple upside down for the presentation and Tamarind Margarita for the taste and texture. Although I wouldn't mind if the Tamarind margarita was less watery. We were introduced to Chef Murali and joined by Executive chef Sandeep who was kind enough to spend time with us while we dined. Mexican fare followed with right amount of break between every dish.The beautiful looking non-veg empanada was served first. Being a vegetarian I couldn't try, it looked like a fancy, Indian Gujiya from the outside served with sauces. Next came - Nachos with cheese sauce, guacamole salsa and Mango salsa dip. The cheese sauce dip went well with Nachos, the flavour of tangy mango in the salsa came out as a winner. The guacamole dip had some chunks of raw/ unripe avocado in it, which made the guacamole dip slightly bitter. Corn and bean in tarts with Salsa Rojowas served next. It tasted slightly bland without the salsa in my opinion. A good looking, colorful Gemada salsa was served in little glasses. It was a mix of tomato, onion, jalapeÉo salsa. Tasted fresh and crunchy. I loved the fresh salad that was served next - Ensalada Espinaca Y Aguacate, although a mouthful for a name, it was definitely my favourite. Spinach, avocado salad, with cilantro dressing, tossed with slices of red radish, cherry tomatoes and ripe alphonso mangoes. Absolutely delicious, and I went for 2 servings The tostadas stuffed with onion, tomato and zucchini was light on the palette and adequately crispy. The Tacos were also light and crispy, but the filling lacked the distinct zing I was hoping for.Paprika flavoured rice was my next favourite. I was too full to enjoy the beautifully presented Tamale.The Tres Leches/ milk cake and Churros were served for dessert. The Tresleche with layers of milk - filling, topping and heavy cream would be an excellent choice for all the milk lovers. The churros with few flavours looked bright and appealing, tasted slightly soggy. The vodka tasting, chef Sandeep's hospitality, knowledge of the served food, the taste of salad, tamale, paprika rice, mango salsa and tres leche were the highlights in my opinion.Nook is a great option for all the folks working in and around the business park , who'd like to dine in a fancy restaurant in large groups. I would like to come back and try out their regular fare too, until then I would call this a pleasant dining experience. Ajit Induchudan Dushyant Chillale ( Buttertheory.com ) Nikita Mulchandani"
4,A decent place. They conduct quite a few food festivals. Being close to the place of work this joint is frequented very often.Both the variety in the veg and non veg buffet has quite a few assortments to choose from.The price is in line with the offerings and hence you would not think on the damage.Enjoy the visit.
3,This wasn't our first choice for team dinner but being accessible made us go here. The ambiance is nothing to boast about with pretty plain decor and not so great acoustics for the music. The food did have its share of variety in all the courses but the quality did not make the cut. The desserts were the best part of the meal. A very low value for money place.
3,"I went for buffet lunch from office.. It's like official :p not many snaps I took..taste wise not good for me.. But so many salads, main course and deserts.. Taste is OK ok for me. For the price.. Can visit once.. It's more like Western and Indian and Chinese style.. Chinese some what ok.."
4,"It was a sudden plan and we headed towards Aloft and to my surprise it was 'Pan Asian Food Festival'. Awesome spread of buffet for both veg and non vegetarians. There were a couple of delicious salads well presented and tasted out of the world.The first thing that i tasted was Momo which was amazing I tasted almost everything and everything was of utmost quality. My fav was coconut custard with egg (desert), chicken red thai curry with rice and basa fish fry and all were relished!The staffs were courteous and everyone right from the receptionist to the staffs and the chef treated us with grace.. Overall its a must visit for foodies..On special request chef prepared pasta in white sauce and that was delicious!Food 4.5/5Ambiance 4/5Staffs 4.5/5Service 4/5Overall 4/5Reservation is must.."
4,"What an experience! Right from the time we arrived all the way till the final click (I'll come to this later). We were group of 10 headed here for a team lunch. The decor/ambience was five star. And so was the buffet spread. What a sight to see at the spread! Right from a plethora of salad, starters to breads, mains, and desserts. They serve a variety of proteins from fish, chicken, lamb, and tenderloin. Vegetarians need not fret. The spread is equally vast. The dessert spread was outstanding too. Right from variety of pastries, macaroons, tarts, crispy meringue to desi delicacies. In the end, the staff clicked a snap of our group and instantly got us a hard copy of it. That was indeed a cherry on top. At 1099/- + tax, this is the money well spent. Thanks Aloft for making this an eventful lunch."
4,"Nook at Aloft, the place is a synonym for specially curated food festivals, I can only say, that there is no such place similar of Nook in the city which organises food festivals at such a quick pace. At the time I went for #FBAI and Burrp event on sneek peak of Aloft's valentine's day menu, their Kashmiri food festival was about to kick off right after that.Ç Chef Sandeep's team had designed a menu worth a thousand words for the occasion of celebrating love. The starters were lip smacking, the chicken gelauti kebabs and Mutton Turkish Seekh need a special mention in my description because they were simply irresistable.Ç The event also highlighted the restaurant's in-house experimentation on infused vodkas with around 18 varieties of spirit lined up for food-bloggers to taste. They intend to be the first restaurant in India to have 99 types of infused vodkas to serve.Ç The main course for the pre-valentine eve of Chicken served on the bed of rissotto in plum sauce with Prawn and grapefruit and Saffrom aioli. The chicken was very dry and lacked the juices but prawns tasted good.The dessert platter seem to have stolen the thunder from all other courses and put the chef's dessert team right in the center spot to reserve accolades from the whole group. The team at Nook is very friendly, makes suggestions and offers just the best to you.Ç It is an ideal place to unwind and catch up with colleagues or friends over drinks and some delicious food."
4,"Been to Aloft Ceesna multiple times for office conferences and workshops but never been to Nook the restaurant and bar.The bar is adjacent to front desk and an open one. Behind the bar counter is the restaurant and on a weekday evening place was packed with people thanks to the adjacent tech parks.The occasion was an official dinner along with friends and colleagues.The buffet spread is great with a wide selection of Indian and continental veg n non-veg fare.Some of the things which caught my attention are falafel bullets, spicy rolls and salad bar.There was a great choice of gravies both veg n non veg.For Desserts gajarka halwa, Tiramasu n pinna cota were the highlight.Service is good for buffet place.Definitely a great option for office parties."
4,"Ambiance: the place has a nice feel deep coloured lounge setting. Eclectic feel and stylish classic decor.Food: surprised to find some really nice spread. The starters were perfect except a little greasy but yummy none the less. Main course: good Indian spread wth a few oriental dishes. The highlights ofcourse were the chats. The samosa chat was particularly delectable. The main course was conspicuous of the absence of any Italian dish, but the other cuisines made up for it.Desserts: had 2 pastries which were eggless along with ice cream.if u r in the outer ring road near marathahalli area it's do check it out it'll b worth it.VFM: pretty good. For 1000 bucks seems slightly on the higher side but you won't feel disappointed at having been there. Would recommend it."
5,"The best place for buffet..ambience is out of this world,staff super friendly and so warm welcoming. You get tons of variety to eat for buffet. Desserts are just awesome. Loved it..."
3,"Went here for a team lunch on a Friday. We were a little late for the lunch (reached around 2 PM) and went for the buffet. The overall experience was average.Food: 3/5Starters served were cold and tasted OK. Desserts spread was good.Ambience: 4/5Very nice look and feel of the place. Interiors very nicely done.Service: Went for the buffet, so won't rate service.Price: 3/5The food was not worth the price. It looked like paying a premium of dining in Aloft"

4,its gives of very positive vibe as the hotel lobby is colourful nd buffet spread @ nook is good. Highlights was grilled lamb and beef which were perfect and melt in month. Grilled vegetables and rosemary potatoes were also worth mentioning.
4,"I visited for a team lunch yesterday. In general the Aloft in Cessna Tech Park is a bit too gaudy for my taste. However Nook was a pleasant surprise , modern and decently elegant. The buffett spread was extensive and good.There was a seafood festival theme and it was evident from a fish grill counter. I had a grilled mackarel and some grilled prawns. Very tasty. I absolutely loved the Seafood thermidor which had mushrooms apart from the seafood and it was made in white sauce and was baked. Thumbs up for that.The Indian fare on offer was good too with my team mates loving the mutton biryani and the paneer curry that was on offer. The cheese platter was enticing with the Camembert , cheddar and cream cheese.The spread of desserts was amazing too and I absolutely loved the apple pie. The other items in the spread like the mousse and jellies were tasty and yummy.Overall I loved the place but why did I give it a 4.0 ? The price. It was exhorbitant. Well it attracts corporates who end up charging their companies for that food and of course they do not mind. I had thought earlier that I would bring my family to enjoy some great food but the price has gotten me thinking.Ç So my recommendation is that if you have a office / team party and you can afford this little extravangance this is a sure place to visit.Ç But if you are coming on a weekend with your family and are budget conscious then coming here might be a little surprise for your pocket."
4,"Well, there was an ÇìEat on PleaseÇù aka ÇìAmritsari Food FestivalÇù at ÇìNookÇù in Aloft Bangalore Cessna Park, which is one of the prestigious properties of Starwood Hotels.We dropped in to ÇìNookÇù for a lunch and the restaurant was well decorated with Vivid Colors and the overall atmosphere catered a best dining experience. The restaurant was full house and I hardly saw empty table that is something commendable in a Star Hotel.The ÇìNookÇù is well known for the buffet, as the spread over here is just amazing with Indian, Continental, Mediterranean, Chinese and Thai.Our lunch started with ÇìKesar LassiÇù, which was much needed for us to beat the heat in the afternoon. As we traveled almost 20 miles, the drink was truly savoring and thick though.We were keener on Main course than starters, so we bumped trying dishes like Stuffed Kulcha, Makki ki Roti, Dal Makhani, Paneer Methi, Chole, Sarson ka Sang, Achari Baingan Masala and Aloo Gobhi.Everything was extremely good and appealing!I would love to visit again in upcoming days and i will definitely recommend this Place."
3,"opted for buffet. Spread was quite good, fair choices of salads. Starters were served on the table. Most of the food was mild and even the Indian curries were toned down (which we liked anyway). Highlights was grilled lamb and beef which were perfect and melt in month."
4,Wow! What a spread at the buffet...tried the all American buffet event they had goin on. Must say that they had a well thought out and very tempting spread. All the dishes were well prepared n had the freshest ingredients. Chicken in barbeque sauce and the salads were amazing.
3,Nothing special about their food. The interior designing of the place stands out. The service was not up to the mark. They can make it better in every aspect.
3,Classic Business hotel food..nothing bad nothing awesome. .the interiors are quite funky and stand out. .decent place for a dinner..quality of food was good even though taste could have been better

It was one of the most impressive spreads I had ever seen at an event, and each of the dishes, well whatever I managed to try, was distinctly made, not just like any buffet that youÇÑd find. So we went back for a week day dinner to try more. Nook is a bright cheerful restaurant that serves buffet in lunch and dinner, though they have an a la carte menu as well. They had a Punjabi food festival running during that time. And no, they werenÇÑt just making Punjabi food, they had chefs and owners from Dhabas in Punjab actually come down to Bangalore and make authentic dishes. A chef from Sodhi da Dhaba in Jallianwala Bagh had actually brought ingredients and spices from back home to make the dishes as authentic as possible! Our meal started with thick kesar lassis, followed by a variety of starters ÇÄ Malai Kabab, Tandoori Prawns, lamb chops and lamb sheekh, each rich in flavor, and delightful to taste. The makki roti and sarso saag that followed, totally took the cake. The saag was slow cooked to perfection, and the crisp roti complemented it well. Another vegetarian main that was great was dal badi with potato curry. The badi was fried and crushed, and this preparation was the best IÇÑve had of it. The chana masala was another ace, one of our favorites that evening! They had a Punjabi gosht curry as well, well cooked meat, rich spicy curry, but it faded slightly in comparison to the vegetarian dishes! For dessert, after this kind of meal, the space left is quite less. But kheer, sevaiya, and jamun got me hungry again, and despite trying my best to resist, much to my husbandÇÑs amusement, I ended up finishing the dessert after a bit of dilly-dally! A good place for groups to get together, their buffet spread is quite extensive. Will definitely get my team to come here!"
4,"Visited nook for a office lunch on a Friday. We booked it a table before hand but the number of guests were more than the booking. They were completely sold-out but the floor staff made sure that we were accommodated.The staff were nice and friendly.The spread was quite good and tasty. I liked their biriyani , smoked salmon, chicken bhuna and the fish items. The salami s were also good... Actually I liked almost all of the items that I tasted... I wish they had nonveg pasta... While the taste was good but it was veg only option.There were many items in the desert spread and tasted good but I wish they had given some exotic twist to the same.As a whole I liked what I got and would visit again."
4,"Punjabi cuisine is accompanying with food from the Punjab expanse of India and Pakistan. The fare has a rich tradition of many diverse homegrown ways of cuisine, out of which one is a special form of tandoori cooking style. I have been eating Punjabi dishes from many restaurants in Bangalore, but really not sure about authentic dishes of Punjab. The restaurants start serving fusion dishes because of cosmopolitan influence and people addicted to customized dishes more than authentic ones. There are very few restaurants in the town that serves authentic food."
4,"We visited the nook for their ongoing Punjabi food festival. Ç The food served at the festival was authentic...aloft featured Chef Sodhi and his team from Punjab (Sodhi da Dhaba) 90% of the ingredients were shipped from PunjabÇ to create wonderful kulchas and curries .Ç What i liked at the festival? Lassi, Keema paratha, Sarsoon ka Saag and Dhal Halwa.I personally don't have the time to visit Punjab and taste authentic punjabi food this visit wasÇ worth an experienceÇ andÇ appreciateÇ the efforts aloft created for their customers.."
2,"Very poor experience , went with colleagues for Lunch. This makes me to post my first reviewWent on a Punjabi food fest, as starters are served on table, they took a long time to come and missed few plates as well.Ç Welcome drink was on table when people started having main course. I think they have only 1 veg starter option as nobody came to server another or for the second time. On a table of four, they put Just 4 panipoori though no one asked, maybe some sort of new fashion which i didn't understood as wellFor Lunch, food was average, nothing exciting. Only Choole Khulcha was something new rest was below averageDesert was Ok,would suggest definitely to opt other options in ORR"
3,"Liked the food quality, good ambience, friendly staff. However, starters were not up to the mark. They are charging 1000rs for buffet, I believe it is on higher side."
4,"We went for a team lunch at Nook. The ambience was amazing. The host was very attentive and hospitable, and the dishes were extremely varied. I'm not sure why the other reviewers felt a lack of variety. Think of lunch as a 3 course meal and you won't be disappointed. The soup was okayish, salads were great. And food was very good, not extraordinary, but very good. Desserts are also very good.Starters - 5/5Main Course - 4/5Desserts - 4.5/5"
3,"Went here with colleagues for dinner. Hotel is spacious and there's a real Cessna type plane that's hung up from the roof! Apparently it's the owner's and he used to fly it himself.When we went there was Rajasthani food festival going on and we settled in for buffet. Guess that was the mistake. Seating was quite comfortable. Sadly it had very less option for vegetarians and only 2 starters  even the waiters took forever to serve and we had to repeatedly keep calling them for things. After the disappointing starters we went ahead for the Mains and sadly the vegetarians woes continued. Though non veg had some variety - chicken, mutton, beef, fish and some other meat too. People did praiae the fish starter.Welcome drink was a joke and the mock tails we ordered were served when we were almost done with the starters!Only saving grace was the dessert where they had some good options and I loved the cheesecake.Ambience: 4/5Drinks: 2.5/5Starters: 2.5/5Mains: 3.5/5Price: A little on the expensive side Service: 2.5/5"
4,It is a good place for food... I had veg food... It was great... Nice services... I am not sure about price but you can assume a five star one...
3,"Aloft is just next door to my office and is frequented by my team for get-togethers, birthday celebrations, service anniversaries and more..I have liked the place always and till date, have tried their lunch buffet three-four times..The place is warm and the staff is courteous..More so, the variety of items in salads, starters, main-course and desserts in the buffet is wide an deep..A good place to visit for office team outings and corporate lunch / dinners :) :)"
3,"Ambiance is quit decent over here. Lunch buffet is not impressive at all. They did not have much options. At this price definitely people will expect something better... Taste of the food is fine not great, staff is nice. The dessert counter was nice.Ç Suggestion for the hotel: kindly increase the options in buffet Ç (specially for veggies)."
3,Have had their breakfast buffet... Quite good variety of food... Good mix of Indian and continental food....loved the chicken sausage the most... Masala omelet is a must try...
3,"Plenty of options, attentive wait staff. Food isn't all that tasty and borderline bland given the foreigners it attracts. Good place to take non-Indian guests, the will leave happy."
4,Wen there for a team lunch and was not disappointed. Wide varieties of food on buffet which provides good options. Great place to have executive lunch. Definite try is Fish stew. Desserts were amazing. overall a delightful experience.
4,Good breakfast spread and taste. It was nice gesture by Nook and was pleasantly surprised by a personal Happy Journey cake presentation at the table.
3,Was here on a usual Weekday.. waiting for a friend to arrive.. so just tried out the breakfast.. The buffet spread was nice.. Had really good varieties.. Their Dosa was really Crispy.. as I wanted.. and the Green Coconut Chutney just recalled my mom's recipe.. It was fantastic.. The white Chocolotae Doughnuts were simply Yummy.. I could not resist myself from having those.. because when it comes to Chocolates.. Resistance is Futile.. Saurabh Thakur.. The F&B Manager was really very helpful and interacted with me couple of times.. Chef Dilips Eggli counter was something to crave upon.. Nice Omelettes.. Ambiance wise.. very cool.. casual dining.. Loved it!!!
1,"I went there with my team for a Team Lunch. And as they you can't judge a book by it's cover; you sure as hell can't judge how food tastes from the way it's presented. It was not good at all although it looked yummy. Everything about this place is good, i.e, the variety of food, the hygiene, the service etc, EXCEPT the food. It tasted pathetic. Everyone in our team was disappointed. I wouldn't recommend anyone to go there."
1,"Dissappointment and Embarassment of being a HOST.The food was 3rd class.Nothing was proper except the ambience,the 1 rating is for the ambience only,Let me explain further:starter:served cold,didn't has much variety was tasteless tooMain course : Tasteless,As if they have poured warm water to make the gravy.Dessert: Variety was good but again tasteless and stale things.Management: Worst,they were in there own world.Only thing they know was to smile.Folks please avoid this place,if your money is hard earned and you love food."
3,"Went here for a team lunch but didn't find it so good. Decor and food choice was good but most of the food was cold. Service was average. We're told that starters will be served on table but only one chat was served in first 20 minutes. When everyone started helping themselves, they brought couple more."
2,"Not a good experience at all. Ç Right from starters to main course to Dessert, nothing was impressive at all. The starters were served cold and bland. In the main course the choices were not that great. The worst was the chicken biriyani among all. The dessert counter was also nothing great. Overall below average buffet and they are upto selling membership to the guests. That was irritating."
3,"We visited Nook during one weekday afternoon to treat our UK team members. The restaurant as well as the hotel Aloft has a very modern decor - colorful walls, stylish furniture and upholstery.Now coming to the food - I would say its pretty good - specially the steamed basa fish and the roast chicken. I particularly liked their desserts more than the main course - their mandarin chocolate with apple and orange marmalade and almond financier with cream is a must try if you are visiting Nook.Overall Nook in Aloft is a nice restaurant on the outer ring road to dine and wine with colleagues or families ."
3,"On a Saturday afternoon after having lunch with our friends at Meghana, we decided to hang out at Aloft to catch up and talk. It is a hotel located inside Cessna Business Park near Bellandur. As soon as you enter the hotel's lobby, there is a huge sitting area with comfy and colourful sofas. The hotel lobby's ceiling is the one to watch out for! They have hung a nice airplane from there. Then at one end, there's a bar where you can have drinks and on the other end, there is a small cafe. You can also play pool here. It's a cool place to hang out. Had a great time here catching up with friends. We had drinks and played pool for about one and a half hours. Only disadvantage I felt was that the air conditioning was not that effective. And there were a few flies here and there. This is something the management should really take care of. "
4,"I see lot of reviews here which are not impressive but I differ here because my experience was much more better than mentioned in others review.Quality of food is really good, most of the foods were continental.there were variety of fish items Solomon Ç and others, starters and soup was good.there number of deserts were huge might be more than 10 types of deserts which were awesome.I certainly go there again."
1,missing the quality and service.tiramisu was pretty much like whipped cream.soup was one spicy colored hard water.starters forgotten to be served at the table though was asked by the manager very lousy service
1,Pathetic food. Most including soup was cold. Too overcrowded. No Space to move. Ambience not good enuf. Some of the salads overcooked. PastaÇ was undercooked.Ç Chicken was rubbery. No complimentary drink as well.Ç In short too expensive for what they had to offer!!!!!!! I dont recommend this placeÇ to anyone.
2,Third Class food..... They don't even have cheese in breakfast spread. I have tasted their most food items since I spent 5 nights in hotel and had to eat there out of compulson.
3,Ambience: Spectacular.Food: Not so spectacular.A place which will please your eyes but will not please your taste buds. The food buffet is mediocre.
1,"If you want to go to a place (only) for its looks and grandeur you have arrived at your destination. It seems the kind of place that bows down to greet you and falls on its face.We were a dozen guys out for a team lunch. The reservations were already made a day in advance considering the friday afternoon rush at places.The moment you spot it from a distance, you are blown away by the majesty of the place. Though you will have to go through a pretty elaborate security check (which is good) for the actual look and feel. It seems like you have arrived somewhere grand. But \"
1,"Nothing Great...We went on Saturday night expecting something nice.Not many starters to start with. No live counters either. No eggless desserts (except for 2-3 Indian sweets which were also ordinary). Worse, whatever else was on offer was also bland. No new/innovative dishes either. There were two dishes which had the same main ingredients and tasted also similar.Staff was courteous but didn't know much about the dishes. Decor was quite good. Chef prepared some eggless mousse for us when we complained about the lack of eggless options.Overall, a bad experience."
2,"Music is cool, ambience is jus fyn, but food is not so great."
3,Nice ambience. Very friendly staff. But very average food. There are very few options (1-2) for vegetarian starters. Main course and dessert are decent. Nothing spectacular! Very expensive for the quality of food.
2,Did not have a good experience here. We were the second batch during lunch. Most of the items were not available. Some items even after request was not brought to us. If there is not enough items for second batch why to have it.
2,"Went for a team lunch for 20 since our office is in cessna, this review is based on a single outing here. There was a 50% discount for employees so the whole restaurant was packed to bursting. Seating is comfortable, ambience was just ok. The starters were served on the table. This was hilarious because there were only 2 starters. OOne was chicken tikka (ok, not dry, well spiced) the other was tandoori aaloo (it was meh). Chutney needed to be asked for and finally one little dish arrived for a table seating 10. The buffet had two uninspired soups (dal shorbha and sweet corn chicken). The salad section was interesting but a challenge for the vegetarians since all the boards had moved. The tzatziki was lovely, and I spotted hummus but no pita was to be found. The couscous lamb salad lacked flavour and was a bit dry. I would have liked to see some seafood here. The pasta salad was ok.Mains - everything looked rather greasy to me especially the Indian stuff. So I tried the grilled veg (good) and meats -chicken and beef (ok, more flavor needed)The burnt garlic noodles were oily and did not have the garlic kick, the oriental style fish was nice. (seriously have more seafood).Dessert- In mango season, it was conspicuously missing from the dessert table. The mango ginger yogurt sounded nice but was lacking the mango. the chocolate cake could have been moister. The apple crumble was actually nice and buttery but was overpoweringly sweet.Overall the team wasn't pleased. (Absolute barbecue was booked full).I would reserve judgement until I've tried ala carte. Since this isn't fine dining and a buffet at that, I didn't expect to be wowed, but this was not a good use of our money."
1,"Beware of this restaurant!!!!!!!!!!!!. They sell Non-Veg soup in the name of Veg!!I had been there for team lunch on 28th May 2014The boards of Veg and non-veg soups were exchangedAll vegetarians had chicken soup instead of Veg soup.Dear Staff,Please make sure you don't fool people around like this.Next time make sure the name of the dish matches with the content in the container!!Note: We were the first team to start the lunch Buffet. So DO NOT assume that the boards were interchanged by someone.It was exchanged from the beginning itself by your own Staff!!"
