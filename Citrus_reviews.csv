1,In Zomato it shows as 4700 for two. But In reality itÇÑs 8177 for two. It miss guides customer.
3,Buffet food felt not fresh.
2,Limited and not great vegetarian choices and the service can be better being one of the top hotels in the city.
5,awesome experience
1,I went for the dinner buffet on Wednesdays for my husband's birthday. The quality of the food was extremely bad. It was s grill night and we couldn't eat any of the starters properly. All meat items were not fresh and were extremely hard and dry. The assortment for main course was very limited and not upto the mark at all. I felt like I wasted so much money on this buffet and we couldn't eat anything at all. I am not going to visit Citrus again.
1,"I had a terrible experience at Citrus-Leela Palace Bangalore. There was a cat walking on the table and licking the plates and glasses. The place was left unattended for quite some time and no one bothered to drive away the cat. If we see such a nuisance happening at such places, I'd better dine at home from now onwards. Such an act of negligence may cause serious illness including rabies to the people who will have their food on those plates later. Not visiting again!"
5,Wow ! Nice team lunch over a amazing spread
5,We came here for dinner with family. The ambience was amazing. The food was great. Manoj was very helpful with the service.
3,The food taste needs to improve plus more options for veg buffet should be added. Very less options for vegetarians 
1,"Yesterday we had been to citrus buffet for lunch to celebrate my brotherÇÑs birthday. It was a mere waste of money. I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone. The spread was very limited with stale food which was cold and distasteful. The dishes were not being replenished in a timely manner. Most of the food was frozen and hard to chew. The service was also bad. I had requested for a small complimentary cake to celebrate his birthday, I had to remind them several times to bring it to the table. The citrus buffet does not live up to the standards of The Leela brand at all. It is a dark spot on the brand."
5,Barbecue was on . Good choice of spread in buffet menu . Awasome .
3,food was average..ironically their quattro at leela in bhartiya city was much better
1,Food was pathetic. Cold n no taste
1,had a stomach upset after 31st dec brunch..still grappling with it. this after paying 4k per head. service was also quite slow
1,Service is crap. Food is crap.
5,"Good food, especially pizza, malai boondi and hummus"
2,"We visited Leela Palace recently and we captivated by the magnificent ambiance. Unfortunately, the dining experience fell short as the herb-grilled chicken lacked moisture, making it challenging to eat. Moreover, the accompanying potatoes were initially forgotten, only brought to us upon reminder. It's disappointing to encounter such errors in a hotel of this caliber."
1,"Pathetic experience for a buffet, options were very less and each and every item was disappointing. A couple items were also puke inducing. Most of the meat felt like frozen meat and nothing fresh. No beverages are included in the buffet even though the charge is 2500+ per person. Neither is the service worth the price. You are just basically paying for the pics you get to take with the hotel architecture and ambience. Would say nearby Hilton is a far better buffet option at the similar price range."
2,"Visited this place on our anniversary.The food was not good and cold.Moreover I had a upset stomach after eating this.Starter spread is very basic.Desset is just full of cakes , hardly any gud Indian desert.Overall disappointing experience"
3,"This was my second visit to Citrus @ Leela Palace BLR and I went there with my wife on our marriage anniversary and I had mentioned that while booking a table via Zomato and had also called them but I guess they donÇÑt read your special requests or they just ignore. Food & buffet spread were just okay, no welcome drink, only desserts were great. Staffs were courteous enough but they were too busy on a Friday afternoon & we had to literally wave èª and wait for their attention. So, overall I was kinda disappointed with the service even after paying a premium. The only thing I enjoyed was the ambiance which was good for getting clicked.Not visiting again! I donÇÑt recommend!"
5,"What a variety of buffet, just loved the experience.. staffs were good and attentive.. loved the service..Buffet was great and ample amount of sittings.. everything tasted great..Must visit for special occasions.."
5,Amazing food across cuisines! The desserts were awesome too!
4,"Food was OK, Ambience was great...."
5,lovely place. should visit to experience the ambience of the place. Priyanka was very helpful with the service.
5,It was a great evening @ Leela and the food was great and they are kind in hospitability
1,"The service was good but the food,the variety of items ever things was bad.. the food items where cold! The food for a 5 star hotel is super bad quality.."
2,The service is great! but the buffet is pretty disappointing!
3,Booked via Zomato and went to celebrate wedding anniversary. Although we had placed a request for outdoor table when we arrived our request was either not known or ignored. Even though outdoor tables were available but we were told that no outdoor table was there. The food was average and did not deserve such a high price. The only good thing was the buffet spread which contained excellent salads and desserts. The staff were quite courteous but overall service was just fine. Not going here for celebrations. You may find better ambiance and food at other top rated places on Zomato. Overall a 3 out of 5.
5,Excellent experience.variety of food is amazing.
5,"The food, ambience and service were excellent. Manoj and Sweta offered an exclusive dining area for us (a party of 10). Their recommendations and attention made the experience a very memorable one. I would come back in a heartbeat!"
5,"Food ambience service good, but no room for baby care or feed."
4,Great ambiance and a large variety in the buffet. but the quality of food and service was average
1,food variety is very bad
5,"The Service, food and ambience was amazing."
1,"Service , food , atmosphere is very good, but the water glasses smelled so bad, I almost puked, very very disgusting, all the glasses smelled same, I think they never wash their glasses"
4,Before entering every stuff use to welcome usWhen going time all staff ignore an show attitude in the entrance
1,Really dissatisfied by the food
1,"Very very disappointing experience at Citrus - The Leela Palace, BangaloreI went to Citrus today for dinner buffet on account of my birthday. Considering the brand name - The Leela Palace, I was looking for a great overall experience. Unfortunately, i had a really bitter experience. Starting with food, the starters, main course menu was very limited, it was around 9pm and most of the items were getting over and they didnÇÑt have the courtesy to refill it. The desserts were awful as well like the starter and main course. In terms of taste, it was horrible, the quality of food could be easily compared with any local restaurant. It was just bad.In terms of ambiance, well there was no ambiance, it was a complete chaos looked like a fish market where people were speaking loudly, yelling at each other, taking pictures at every part of the restaurant. Infact, people surrounded our table from all sides as they were taking pictures and didnÇÑt realise that there are other people who just wants to have their food peacefully.In terms of service, the staffs were not at all friendly. They were bothering us every ten minutes with this and that. At 10 pm, they were literally forcing us to complete our dinner as the restaurant closing time was 10:30. After repeatedly raising our concerns to the staffs, they didnÇÑt take any action and they were extremely casual about the issues we have raised. The floor manager didnÇÑt know how to communicate and we was doing unnecessary things like asking if he can offer us with some extra desserts or food items, like seriously!FYI - Table No 25, visited on 13th SepÇÑ23 at 9pm"
5,Food was very good !! Ambiance at its best ! Very good hospitality! Will definitely visit again

3,My review is based on the alacarte. I loved the starter I tried but was a bit disappointed with the main course. But the staff was extremely courteous and ambience was really good.
5,excellent food & brilliant service by Rajat.
5,one of the best ambiences in Bangalore
3,too crowded
2,
1,"Extremely rude staffs and bad vibe. We went there for outdoor seating and due to rain, there was no outdoor seating available, we asked the staff if we can checkout other restaurants at Leela , the staff mocks us and laughs saying \"
3,Food was average !! Very expensive for the portion size Service was poor Ç food was cold when served Chicken curry was good .. portion could be better Prawns served were frozen.. only 4 pcs Overall very average food Ç
5,"Great ambience , the spread was extensive . Loved the chocolate mousse"
5,It's not 4000 for two but 4000 for one. We went last Sunday for a brunch buffet. It is wrong information
3,did not feel that good
1,I didn't get pizza
5,This place is really amazing.Dulal was taking very good care of us.
1,Taste
5,"The menu at Citrus features a wide variety of dishes from around the world, with a focus on Mediterranean and Asian cuisine. The restaurant uses only the highest quality ingredients, many of which are sourced locally, and the dishes are expertly prepared by the talented chefs.Some of the standout dishes at Citrus include the sushi platter, which features a variety of fresh and flavorful sushi rolls, and the pan-seared salmon, which is cooked to perfection and served with a delicious miso glaze. The desserts are also a highlight, with options like the decadent chocolate mousse and the refreshing citrus sorbet.In addition to the excellent food, Citrus also offers an extensive wine list, with a variety of international wines to choose from. The restaurant's luxurious atmosphere and impeccable service only add to the overall dining experience, making it a popular choice for special occasions and romantic dinners.Overall, if you're looking for a luxurious dining experience with delicious food and impeccable service, Citrus is definitely worth a visit. The restaurant's focus on high-quality ingredients, expertly prepared dishes, and exceptional service make it one of the best dining options in Bangalore."
5,thank you. yummy
5,"Visited on a Sunday for Brunch. The place is extremely well maintained. Entire premise was squeaky clean. Their buffet spread is one of the best in Bangalore, they have many options for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians and each item tasted great. Specifically the dessert collection was the best I have ever seen compared to other Five star places. The entire experience was superb. Definitely going back there again."
1,The cakes are delicious but they forget to make them when you place an order. This is 3rd time in a row that the cake is not ready despite ordering more than 24 hours in advance. Wonder where the glitch and gap isÇ..Maybe they donÇÑt careÇ.
3,"It was a lunch buffet and somehow I was not satisfied with the variety as compared to buffet price. Taste-wise everything was decent, I must say dessert section was amazing but the main attractions was the ambience. I was mesmerised by the architectural beauty of Leela Place. If you want to spend your money on aesthetics with food then this is a good place to go!"
3,Went for lunch buffet but not satisfied with the taste and variety. Expected more variety and taste food. Not worth for money.
1,"Had buffet at LeelaÇÑs, it was a horrible experience. Not expected such kind of quality from such a reputed place. The food was missing all the flavours. Just not worth. "
1,"It was honestly the worst Indian Food I have ever tasted. Even the paneer tikka was flavourless (it only smelled of sarson ka teel) and was very hard and chewy, the pasta also had no flavour only a thin tasteless white sauce when complained they just added cream and made it thick. Overall had a vey bad experience and it ruined a special occasion."
3,"Went to celebrate my husbandÇÑs birthday by having lunch at leelas, Pretty shocked to have found a cockroach in my pasta, they charge you a lot and for that price your are suppose to maintain a certain level of cleanliness, be mindful & maintain a level of standard cause your the Ç LEELA PALACEÇÑ However the staff were really sorry waived off the entire bill."
5,"tasty hakka noodles, portion was good."
1,Bery bad experience I had with this place. Food was below average and staff doesn't care about it if you wanna talk about it with them. Really disappointed even manager was not there and no one attended us.
5,Excellent preparation. Very good packing.Best biryani I have ordered in a long time.
1,food not tasty
1,"Such a overrated place. Bland ,tasteless and completely cold food. Even dessert seems stale.Went there to celebrate our special day but turn out to b very disappointing. Even a regular restaurant provides hot food. Plz don't waste ur money at this so called premium place. Rather go to any other non premium place in Bangalore they give u best service with awesome food."
5,"Excellent packaging and hygiene as always. Wish the Citrus zomato menu was larger, would love to see more items on there !"
3,Visited Citrus for Sunday night buffet dinner. Spread was comparatively less. Food was of decent taste and quality. The AC was faulty and I was sweating throughout the dinner. Expected a much better buffet.
5,great experience and great value for money considering its from Leela Palace. the quantity and quality of the items were very good
5,Wonderful restaurant and lots of options. Visited there with family for buffet dinner. They have too many options and great staff. Best buffet i have had in Bengaluru.
1,"Horrible Experience. Too crowded, I went with my family, they gave us outdoor seating, it wasnÇÑt our choice, but we were told theyÇÑre overbooked. It rained and we got drenched, no one cared, 4 year old niece was there, it was extremely inconvenient. Not what we expected!!! Poor service, so many staff they just stand still and does nothing  we stood there helplessly for sometime and asked for help, they said theyÇÑre trying to arrange another table, but that didnÇÑt happen, after waiting for 5 to 10, we went back to the same outdoor seating., to top it all, we booked for ÇìlunchÇù but we were charged excessively for ÇìbrunchÇù, something is very off with the billing as it was billed to some room, it was supposed to be around 7 k, i ended up paying 11k + , I asked staff to explain the bill and rate for buffet per head, he wasnÇÑt sure, he gave some random vague numbers. I paid and left that place, wonÇÑt recommend anyone, not worth it! Ambience were good though."
5,"We were helped by Mr. Deepanshu and Mr. Chhatrasal. They were friendly and helpful with their inputs. The place is always clean and well maintained - never had an issue on multiple visits. We usually prefer the outdoor seating if itÇÑs a pleasant evening. ItÇÑs surely better than sitting next to the buffet spread. We had the Spring Roll, Palak Bhutta Seekh, Bombay Sandwich and the Club Sanwich to start off with. Excellent preparation as one would expect. Their spinach and wild mushroom lasagne and cottage cheese kathi roll are yum! DonÇÑt miss their panna cotta and cheesecakes. The buffet options are extensive as well. WeÇÑve had it a couple of times but prefer the alacarte"
5,delicious
1,"Went there to celebrate our fathers birthday, food was a big disappointment. havenÇÑt seen such Limited food options anywhere, food was super cold ,there were flies on the desserts, useless staff inside citrus."
2,Very poor service. Utter mismanagement by staff. Plates were not changed even after asking. Absolutely very less options in starters. We were served one plate cold starters told to us as platter with just 3 options . Desert spread was good though.
1,The food taste is below average...the food in the buffet is stone cold...the spread is average... utterly disappointed...came here for a special occasion...but left dissatisfied....out of all the premium hotels in bangalore...this served the most bland and cold food..°°°§§§
2,"You're paying for being in a palace, not for food. Extremely underwhelming experience. Service was also just as bad. We went there for dinner buffet. Very few vegetarian options. Most of the food was cold, some grilled veggies even smelled funky maybe because they have been sitting out for a long time."
5,"Very well prepared, packed and delivered. Glad that the chef called to clarify about my special request to avoid using refined vegetable oil. Excellent packaging. delivered person handled the delivery well. \"
3,Flies over desserts. Buffet was good but hygiene maintained is low. Flies all over desserts. Liked the starters
1,"Atrocious service at the brunch. We had to ask for the cocktail menu several times, but didn't receive it. We walked out. Never going back again."
1,food is cold because of delay in delivery
3,"With a Brand like The Leela, the least one expects is that the food arrive warm . The packaging as always is very good, clean and tamper proof . Thank you."
1,Very bad service no start level ethics always delay in preparation presentation also is too bad ..I was so so embarrassed in from of my guest Ç
5,"Had breakfast buffet at citrus on sunday. I must say the spread was just awesome, lot of varities with 30+ varieties. There were lot of options for south indian, north indian, and english breakfast. Live counters were also present for dosa, uttapam, chole bhature, alloo pure, and egg fusions..Overall recommended place to spent morning with your family and friends"
1,IÇÑve always patronised Citrus for its Andhra Chilli chicken with steamed rice. But last two experiences were horrible. Once the chillies were sooooo much one couldnÇÑt eat and second time delivery was delayed by over one hour. Not expected out of such a big chain like Leela..
2,"low to average buffet for a 5 star buffet. Indian and mediterranean counters good but continental, cheese selections and desserts were poor. Bad food combined with bad service, makes Citrus an avoidable place, esp at this price point."
3,"Went there around mid night to celebrate my little princess birthday. It was a quick plan - idea was to have some coffee / ice cream and then cut a cake so that she can be happy. Informed the staff of the plan in advance. It was only 3 of us in the restaurant and some 5-6 staffsÇ but seems they were more busy on the closure than attaining to the customer. DidnÇÑt get the ÇìLeelaÇù kind of service experience, it felt like we just disturbed there peace. A little bit of more courteous approach from the staffs could have made our quick 45 mins time more joyful."
2,the good was horrible by the time it reached the cake was all smushed up it didn't even look like cake.
5,"Delicious, thanks"
1,Spillage issue
2,Not expected this from Leela
5,Had a lunch buffet there. Food was refined and amazing. There were several different varieties. Ambience was amazing. The Italian food could be better.
1,
5,Had dinner with family at Citrus and loved the whole experience of a 7 star...great ambience and excellent hospitality...huge buffet spread with awesome quality and tasty food....loved the exotic food options and the best part was the desserts....great place to just hang out and enjoy the peace!...Highly recommend
5,"The food, ambience and the service was great! Would highly recommend to anyone who is in Bangalore. A big shoutout to Pramod! ù for making our experience so much better."
1,Not at all good take 17770 for5 people Biriyani is very very bad quality in reception not even have a manner to talk .... feeling very very bad
3,"It's not clear as what is available in the buffet menu. Not arranged or organized in a proper way. The choice of the desserts was way too less. Citrus is more like a centralised kitchen for their other orders. Ambience is a big let down in the citrus. Despite of booking through dine out ,there is no communication to the restaurant. Fortunately, they accommodated us. Had been here for my birthday ö. But I can say that whatever we had seemed to be tasty. But it's confusing to run across the difference counters/places. They can put up a buffet menu in the display to avoid confusion. We didn't even notice that there is also icecream counter until we were leaving."
4,"I have been wanting to visit Citrus for some time now considering it is not far from where I live. After ages, decided to finally visit it and was disappointed. Located on old airport road, The Leela has always fascinated me with its perfect mixture of old and new world charm and style. We chose to be seated outdoors as somehow, indoor dining is not for me unless there is no other option. I had the carbonara spaghetti that did full justice to the dish. It was not just tossed around in cheap sauce as it tends to happen in most of the places serving the dish but managed to blend the ingredients to the T. The bits of bacon were juicy and succulent and the dish is enough for one.For dessert, it was the Guanaja Gianduja chocolate fudge cake that was heavenly. Add beer and wine to the mix and it was a lovely evening.Service could have been better but considering it was a busy evening, I choose to ignore this lapse. Overall a wonderful experience."
1,rice was not cooked
5,the rice quantity would be better. otherwise the perfect dish.
5,"During our stay at the Leela palace, we went there for our meals. The spread was extensive and whatever I was able to taste was scrumptious. I really loved the kebabs. It was juicy and spicy, the way I like it. There main course and dessert was also good. The biryani could have been better though. The ambience was okayish may be because of the rush of the buffet. They have both indoor and outdoor seating. Given an option, the outdoor seating is a huge upgrade to the indoor one."
5,"So Happy took the decision to go to Citrus to celebrate a friends birthday on a weekday. Completely satisfied by the quality and quantity was excellent. Ranging from fresh breads to wide range of continental dishes to Asian and Indian dishes. A wide range of Middle eastern dips and breads and many kinds of veg and non veg salad. Not to mention the sweets , simply wow. It is super value for money."
5,the perfect thai meal.
1,we ordered Thai green curry.we found this plastic paper in the curry
1,Really irresponsible you didnÇÑt send us the tomato sauce with sandwich how can we eat sandwiches without sauce Ç completely irresponsible
3,liked it as it was not spicy. kevda essence is added. most of the pieces were boneless. Portion is adequate for one person.
1,Looks like while preparing dal the chef burnt the dal. The entire dal tasted burnt and really bad. Didnt expect this from Dal Jamavar from Leela
2,"I went today in Citrus@Leela Palace for celebrating my wife's birthday with fine lunch but unfortunately didn't got such experience. Hospitality was not upto the mark, sometimes felt we are invisible, not even like a normal restaurant. May be we looked normal people :). Place looked dirty, even the napkins are with stain. No Covid protocol maintained, no body asked or bother to check temp or sanitize your hand. I didn't find that good.Only the server was good but seems pretty occupied,but was doing his best. Food was good, that's was what we liked, thank god. But yes, overall experience was really disappointing. 2 stars only for the Food."
1,Terrible.. rice was over cooked. Ordered biryani not kichidi!
1,"I ordered a delivery of Paneer Tikka + Chicken Tikka Masala & Naan combo and it was The paneer was just 4 pieces, thatÇÑs just unacceptable at these prices. The chicken tikka masala was very oily, like a cheap dhaba.Request Leela management to not do this, IÇÑm a regular at your property and this is so disappointing. :)"
1,Added mutton pieces to the chicken biryani and denied the same when a query was raised. Unacceptable for a 7 star hotel!
4,"Nice ambience, polite and courteous staffs, tasty but expensive food, for obvious reasons. Overall, a nice place to hangout with family and friends. Must Visit."
1,The paneer had gone sour. Both in the tikka and saag paneer. The tandoori roti was not delivered. The package had leaked. See photo.
1,"I can't believe Leela's served stale food, we started with salads, veggies were not fresh, the pumpkin in lamb pumpkin salad was stale. There were no meat options, most of the food were frozen food like pita bread. There was no good options in Chinese or continental. The only saving grace was the deserts. They were okay."
3,It's our tradition to dine on 1st Jan. We have been doing this for the past 15 years. We were 7 of us and despite calling at 2:30 we were shocked to find out our name was missing in the reservation list. Thankfully got a table and were packed into a room with a party group of 20+ people.4 people in our family hadn't dined at citrus and I promised them a wonderful evening. Food was quite average. In these times the guests could serve themselves at the buffet. All other restaurants do not allow guests to serve at the buffet.The pasta and pizza were good. That's the only good part of our evening.Desserts were really disappointing. The pastries were very dry. Let's not talk about the Indian desserts.We were hoping to make a good begi.nning to 2021 after all that we went through in 2020. Sadly didn't happen
1,Can't tell you how discusting I am feeling right now sitting over here having pathetic food and so so bad service .. my new year date turned out to be the worst day of my life.. most hyped and overrated place I have ever been in my life.. inside Leela this kind of service and food can't imagine ..
4,Good food. Good location . Understaff . They tend to forget whatever you ask them to get to your table. Need multiple reminders.
3,"Just had a buffet dinner today at Citrus. The overall experience was more like a 2-3 star restaurant with at par sophistication. The staff were helpful , polite.....super groomed. Music / decorations were definitely super. But.....the main purpose of visit was to have a great food. Trust me guys when I say this....you need to improve yourself to be a 5star restaurant as the chief ingredient required (which was lacking) is mouth watering food. Few observations from today's experience. 1. Insufficient quantity. Cooks take loooong time to re-cook / replenish the dishes. I lost appetite with the waiting time for food of a buffet menu. Sounds kinda funny. 2. Two significant dishes out of a few were not available the entire time but the names were in display along with assurance from the saff for supply of the same. 3. The variety of food was ...1,2,3,4....oh shit that's all?? Ok. I was initially was getting angry with the whole situation. Later I was laughing about it 'coz I realised I shouldn't have made such expectations from Leela Palace's own resturant. "
5,I've visited Citrus a few times during my recent extended stay in Bangalore. The best thing I found about Citrus is the staff. I was usually there later in the day and Pramod took care of me. He always went the extra mile to make sure the service is enjoyable pleasant and quick. He's the warmest and most welcoming restaurant manager that you'll ever find.
1,Worst service. I had clearly mentioned that it's an Anniversary dinner and they promised a good table setting but no service was provided as promised. No one even came to even attend us. Simply money and time wasted.
2,"Poor service . Didn't expect this from leela at all.. I ha e been to this place almost more than 10 times.. but this i must say it was worst experience. Came here to celebrate my husband's birthday. First of all we didn't opt for valet parking ofcourse due to current situation, while returning back, one car was there on the driveway parked by valet driver, driver name praveen who was arrogant even after waiting for 20 mins in the parking he didn't accept his mistake. Neither the parking service guy was for assistance his name was Salman who was least bothered. Than we came towards exit no one was there to open the gate.. after hawnking 10 mins one guy came who said sir we are short of staff. Neither the food was good today, these guys were happy to serve some marriage party.. no non veg in the Indian main course.. service was poor..I have a vedio, but unfortunately zomato don't have option to upload. in short it was not a great experience at leela this time."
4,"Overall quite nice . Went for our anniversary lunch today , food was really good . Felt the prawn starter could have been better , we didn't feel like it was value for money , there were just 4 tiny prawn pieces for 1.4k. But other than that , everything else was bang on . Good service , awesome ambience , will surely revisit"
4,"Recently visited Citrus ..Had wonderful breakfast, awesome variety but There is scope for improvement in bakery side, no butter, no jams or no specific counter for bread griller, when asked for butter they served tiny portion which was not sufficient for dry toast..Now for lunch..Appetizers!!! tiniest portion not sufficient for one person..It needs lot of improvement. Main course- Good quantity, appetizing,but serving them took more than 45 mins..Which was mood spoiler..Lastly we celebrated parents wedding anniversary- they could not decorate the room, nor could get the cake better nor sending beautiful bouquet on their spl occassion..the cake tasted like raw marshmellow .It was yuck. We had lot of expectations from your side but guys failed to deliver. Last but not the least..They are following good precautions, tables are getting sanitized after every customer.all are wearing mask with shield."
5,"We have been dying to go for a brunch with friends and after a not so good experience with Alba at the JW Marriott last time we were apprehensive to try out any other place in the city. Asked around and got a couple of recommendations for Citrus at the Leela and decided to go for it. And I am so happy we chose this place. Everything was spot on. Everything that we picked from the counter was immaculate. The grills, pizza, salads, cold cuts, you name it and they nailed it. The only small disappointment would be the laddo (post diwali cravings) and the kaju katli which was a bit too sweet. But hey that would be me nitpicking. But to everyone who is undecided on a brunch place , what sets Citrus apart was the service. Hands down the best staff and service we have come across in any restaurant in Bangalore . We had kids with us and both of them ended up throwing up after a heavy lunch and running around. You should see the empathy and compassion the staff had with the kids and the parents alike in such a situation. If it's brunch it has to be at the Citrus. Life long fan now "
5,"Sunday brunch in the new normal. Menu is shared on phone, tables are distanced, cutlery placed in pouches on table. Love the outdoor seating. There was live music, but honestly the chirping of birds & soothing water music in natural setting could be good too. Appetizers, main course served on table pre plated. For desserts there was a counter. Dessert options & taste could be better. Polite staff. The north Indian appetizers & pizza was good in taste. Overall, good to be brunching back!"
5,"We went for a lunch with my wife on Friday and it's absolutely delighted after soo long time. The restaurant was crowded on Friday lunch and it's good to see soo many people out there like us. It was really stress free lunch . The place is really well manage and maintaining precautions and they offering sanitized cutlery and napkin in a pouch, touch free menu,which is really appreciate. Specially mention \"
1,"On 27th August 2020, I had visited for lunch with family and I had the most horrible experience with the orders we placed. There was no apology or any kind of help offered. We do not eat chicken, yet were served chicken instead of the fish we ordered. Half the orders we called out were not attended and we decided to leave half way through lunch. The food was not taken back ans fixed even after letting the crew know about the taste. We paid the bill and left since no one showed any interest in solving our issue. A 5 star hotel did a worst service than even a normal restaurants inside a mall."
2,"Never have I thought I would say this but I will not be ordering non veg at Citrus ever . We were there for Onam Sadhya and thoroughly enjoyed the meal except the dessert part . One thing I always look forward to when having South Indian meal is the dessert part where kheer is served. But unfortunately the ada payasam served was milky sweet ( the texture of the ada was perfect though) and the sarkkarai pradhaman was sweet to the core. Even the banana that was served along couldn't tone down the sweetness. First time in my life I had to say no to the kheer. I'm disappointed. Also we have ordered Andra chilli chicken with mild heat . The result was a kinda watery semi gravy base with the chicken which was not cooked through and I can swear it's not fresh meat . Clearly the meat couldn't hide behind the mild spices . This is something we didn't expect from Leela's. Again, first time I sent a dish back into the kitchen. Few weeks back I was at a different restaurant and has told them to prepare for me off the menu dish with broccoli. But they told me that the broccoli they have is not fresh. So I opted for mushrooms which turned out to be really good. At Citrus they could have just told us that they were expecting more of Sadhya order and it's not possible to serve chicken as we expected instead of serving something that was clearly not edible. As for service , it was impeccable and we were well taken care . Though it was rush hour , we didn't have to wait much for anything. Even the assistance I got through phone from Ms Kabita in tha last few days deserves a thumbs up."
5,One of my favourite place for brunch. I had been to citrus quite a lot of times. I totally love the ambiance and the brunch spread. I had white wine which was amazing. The food spread was was very tempting.The brunch is lil expensive but being in Leela palace it was worth it. 
5,"Went to Citrus for Sunday brunch and Oh boy! We were amazed by the ambience, crowd, live music and the buffet spread. Despite being a hardcore non vegetarian I couldnÇÑt refrain myself from trying foods with green dots, every thing on the table was delectable. Citrus spoils their guests with too many main course and dessert options and one will certainly be in a dilemma to choose the best ones from them. Liked everything on the menu but mango mousse was lip smacking!"
1,The price you pay its not valuable even for single star.very bad food quality
4,"Planning for weekends? Just go to to citrus restaurant Leela palace. it is a great place with good ambience and live music!!! The staff is also excellent.They serve delicious and varieties of starters, soft drinks, salads, desserts, breads and main menu is also very good.Deserts have huge options. They have separate desert section and play area for kids and definitely kids will love this place."
5,This luxurious restaurant in The Leela Palace just amazing. Great place with beautiful asthetic and some good food. Everything is clean and hygenic. The food presentation stole my heart. Every plate has unique decoration. Service is good and price is high as its a five star Hotel but sure you gonna remember the day for life time.
5,The ambience is real good.ù§Øè
4,"As a final treat towards the end of my visit to Bangalore, my host had booked Saturday brunch at the Leela, having been assured that both wine and beer were included. On our arrival we discovered it was actually only beer, which was a serious disappointment as half of the group did not drink beer and were only there because of the assurance that wine was on offer. The staff at Leela were quick to respond to this problem and we proceeded to have an absolutely delicious meal with both wine and beer flowing, and tremendous service from Kartik who went out of his way to fulfil every desire. Huge tribute to this hotel for coming to the rescue and for giving us a day we shall never forget."
4,hi
5,During our stay here we opt for breakfast and buffet dinner..the name is enough ...I really the this place .. ambience and service is too good ..the place is really like a palace ..it's a beautiful place ..food was tasty though .. overall good experience during our stay ..like to visit again
3,Came here for dinner buffet. Items were limited and left with no choices. Service is average. Only good thing to cherish was the ambience.
4,"Came here for an early lunch - opted for a la carte. Food taste, presentation was really good. Tried the crab cake, murg kabab, fish and chips (it does not come with chips which is weird), nasi goreng.The worst thing is - portion size. It is like very less. Crab cake comes with 1 medium sized piece, kabab has 3 small pieces, nasi goreng is pretty less. Also the time taken for the food to be prepared was a lot given the restaurant was pretty much empty when we got there."
5,"Citrus is the coffee shop and free breakfast restaurant at the Leela , Bangalore.Let me start of by saying that I think this restaurant and hotel has the best and most affordable breakfast spread in Bangalore if not India.Their menu in terms of buffet is mind blowing.They have everything or everything ! I had breakfast and Lunch there in very short spans , the pics are of the lunch , so letÇÑs talk about that. They have a lovely spread of Indian ( South and North ) lovely choices every single time.Pan Asian Choices with lovely choices of Noodles and Rice along with tofu , chicken and beef choices.The European choices are even better.German Pasta , potatoÇÑs Daphene and what not.Unfortunately I donÇÑt think itÇÑs possible for me to cover everything on the menu.As a matter of trust, I would recommend this place again and again."
5,"Hello my lovely foodies..so what's plan...do you planning any 5 star dinning experience in Bangalore..then just head to Citrus - The Leela palace..an awesome experience with great yummy finger licking food..super fine dinning experience with food menu from - North Indian, Italian, asian , continental and meditarranean dishes too choose from...great friendly and well behaved staff...awesome ambience...good food portion with great taste...we tried kabab platter (non veg) which include mutton seekh kabab, fish kebab, prawns, and chicken Tikka each food item was great on taste and very well cooked, also there pasta are great as well...do try there pulled chicken conchiglie pasta ...you will love it...deserts as well superb in taste tried chocolate (which is chocolate fudge cake with caramel , nougat and dark rum flavour icecream) ...liked there fast service and overall a great dinning experience.They do have several other restaurants too in hotel for different cuisine...a good piece of advice. Prior reservation is highly recommended...so go foodies and have a great experience and superb food...do follow me on Google Local guide, Instagram, Zomato, TripAdvisor #ankurthefoodie to know more about great food experience destinations."
1,We had been to this place for our anniversary. The service is not even comparable to what you might expect to receive at a local restaurant. It was that pathetic.We were greeted on our arrival and shown a seat. Post that we were on our own except for when the order was taken and served. The complimentary cake that came with the booking was not offered to us and we left on our own and waited for more than 10mins with our 2mt old baby for our car to be brought to us from valet parking. The worst experience at a 5star restaurant.
5,"We had a chance to stay at the Leela Palace for a couple of days and got a chance to have their massive spread of breakfast which was complimentary.You go insane when you see the number of items that are being offered here for a breakfast. They had most of the cuisines covered in their breakfast menu and what I liked about this place was the fact that they have focused on the small things that matter when you have a meal at a restaurant. The service and hospitality was undoubtedly awesome and most of the stuff on the menu actually tasted good. There was a separate counter for Bakery, Eggs, Salad bar, Juice bar and fruit bar.I thoroughly enjoyed their complimentary breakfast. It is definitely very expensive if you decide to buy the breakfast separately however it is worth a try once in a while when you feel like getting pampered.I would definitely recommend this place for a breakfast."
3,"Sunday brunch is totally overrated at the Leela. They did not have anything special (when compared to the other hotels). Their idea of a play area is one bouncy castle. Absolutely nothing that toddlers care about. They did not have salmon on the menu. I had to ask for it. Nothing exceptional. Totally not work the price I am afraid. To be fair, the menu is reasonably vast but not in comparison to its peers - Conrad, Ritz, Renaissance, Taj Westend etc."
1,"We went for Saturday brunch to Leela, Bengaluru. I was expecting a lot more from Leela. Having been mighty impressed by the service and food in Leela, Chennai. I was extremely disappointed with the tardy service & the cold and tasteless food for most items barring the chicken donne biryani, baked yogurt."
5,"Visited the place with a friend on there Sunday brunch. We opted for the outer seating as there was a live band, thatÇÑs how the moment began. Kick started with a beer with fish & chips to medium rare beef steak with mushroom sauce, grilled chicken breast and Philadelphia cheese cake with coffee to end the course† The fish was served with a perfect thin bread crumbs, perfect crunchiness and the mushroom sauce with the beef steak was Çthe pairingÇÑ. They have options for sauce, so you can choose accordingly. Must try the fish& chips and the cheese cake The best place for brunch in town. Cheers team citrus !"
5,We were 3 people and we shared the food. The cheesecake was decadent. The pizza was very flavorful and perfectly done. The Risotto was creamy and perfectly balanced.
4,"The Leela palace is a beautifully luxurious palace. It's huge and well maintained. I was thrilled to have lunch from Leela palace. The ambience is amazing,with indoor and outdoor seating.While comming to the food, there was a wide variety in salads, main course and the desserts. The salads options were good, with all kinds of meat and vegetarian dishes. The main course was good too. Loved the paneer and mutton. The desserts was my favorite part. Lot of options. Loved the creme brule, Pana Cota, baked yogurt. The chocolate dishes were good but a little too sweet.Overall, had a great time in this amazing palace. Loved the ambience."
1,"We went to Citrus Leela today, it was a team lunch to celebrate our new platform product launch. While the food was great and so our spirit to unwind and have fun, the staff was disappointing. They were quite unwelcoming and discourteous what a pity! I hope you guys work towards training your staff better. We have been to many such places for team outings including Oberoi and they provide much better experience! Never Again."
4,Went for lunch and ended up having the buffet although I had thought against it. Guess when your eyes are in/on your stomach then it's hard to resist.I should have stuck to my instinct of ordering ala carte as buffets usually are standard and I've never been wowed by any buffet leave aside the one at Citrus.When you have bit of everything then it's hard to enjoy and justify any particular dish. Although I leaned towards the buffet as I saw my fav fav Gajar ka halwa on display but it didn't measure upto my expectations.The brownie was out of the world and besides that there was nothing much to write home about.As usual the service as expected at Leela was top notch but I am moving away from buffets for sure.It's not a dig at this particular one but in general it's just not doing it for me.To Ala carte.....ç
4,We went there for a formal luncheon. Mostly fit for corporate engagements. The buffet spread was huge. It is suitable for all sorts of palettes.
4,"After many years we thought of going to Leela palace. The place is just amazing and is so relaxing to be in this hotel.There is absolutely no need to talk about the ambiance as everyone knows that it is one of the best.So we tried the food at citrus this time and ordered, a chicken breast steak, veg biryanis, veg platter and a desert platter..All the dishes was good but the desert platter is a must try..We will be visiting this place more often only for the awesome desert platter.."
4,"The place is beautiful and you would love to have any meal here, it is quiet and has a lovely decor. In terms of food, it was good. We opted for a buffet and a few mock tails. I ordered an orange mock tail and it was yummy. The main course was good as well. Apart from the drinks what stood out for me was the deserts. The shahi tukda was really rich in taste and fresh. The Panacota was really good too. Overall experience was good, however, for the amount they charge I am not keen to visit this place that often."
5,I had been here twice and I had a funny experience. When I came here first time I was not aware that I need to choose the restaurant in the Leela palace as per my food interest and I am expecting something which is not available and at the end rated them low then I was guided to choose the restaurant. I can give 5 star to Citrus
5,I had been here while staying for their Breakfast Buffet. They have an elaborate spread of a variety of different cuisines and you can choose what suits you best. The ingredients are fresh and the dishes are all flavorful. Truly worth the visit.
4,"Leela Palace the garden cityÇÑs only modern palace hotel looks ultra luxurious,we went for lunch buffet and the spread of the buffet was huge, taste of the food and desserts was good,service was perfect.Overall a wonderful experience!"
4,"It is an awesome place to sit leisurely and have great food.The service is humble and elegant. But I felt that people are not attentive. Only 50% of the people there found to be attentive.The environment is awesome! Typical Leela experience. Loved to spend time there after a long time!Went for a Saturday namma Bangalore buffet.The menu is vast and great.Starters: Chats, veg/non veg starters, pav, stir fry everything was good. Especially the pav and chats were awesome! Had a vast collection of salads too!Main course: Really awesome! Had a great collection and loved it.Desserts: Here is a down side. They had a good collection. But all desserts which had chocolate in someway were way too sweet. And most of it contained chocolate. So it was a real big down.Only almond ice cream had normal sugar and others were too sweet.Service : 4/5Ambience: 5/5Starters: 4/5Main course: 5/5Desserts: 2/5Overall a good place to hangout!"
2,"My cousins had previously been to this restaurant and they were all happy about the food, ambience and service. I went there based on their recommendation and was disappointed by the food, it was average. I felt it was not worth the money. You could argue that extra money is for the ambience/ service they provide. But guess what, we were seated outdoors, and I saw a rat roaming around the tables, which I did not expect at such upscale place. I reported it to the manager and they acknowledged it and arranged a indoor table for us. Still my experience was screwed, my bill was waived off by the manager, even after I repeatedly insisted on paying. But at the end of the day I was left disappointed with food(The pasta was chewy and salty) and the experience. I hope the restuarant staff will take care of rodent issue."
4,"Since my office is in the Leela complex itself, I had a chance to dine-in here multiple times for breakfast and lunch or even coffee. Every time, I visited there, I was impressed with their hospitality.They have a huge spread any time of the day and I must say that you will not fall short of options here. Since I am a regular at 'The Leela' - Mumbai, I made a comparison subconsciously while reviewing this place. Though I found Mumbai had a better overall feeling but this place is no less.The things which I found exclusively in The Leela, Bangalroe is fresh coconut water. Obviously, they have more south-indian dishes on offer being in Bangalore.Overall, I am a regular here and can share more as I go."
4,"This was one of the few places still remaining on my bucket list and Grill Night on the first Thursday of May happened to be the date that I decided to finally out Citrus.As the name suggests, the BBQ/grill section of the menu gets straight to the point with items including beef patty, tenderloin, teriyaki, lamb tajdar, shish touk (chicken), assorted seafood (fish, shrimps/prawns, octopus/squid) and paneer.Beef with BBQ sauce (done to medium/med rare) stood out. Prawns and fish were good too (although octopus/squid was a bit bland).The counters with cheese (Gouda, Brie, Emmental), salad (Asian grilled fish with mayo, lamb seekh with onions, chicken tikka, baked fish with broccoli/orange, seared beef with veg, roasted lamb with pomegranate, prawn with pineapple, smoked ham and tandoori veg) and cured/cold cuts (pork mortadella, salami milano, chicken) had something different to offer with each dish when it came to flavor.Main course items included Dal, kadhai paneer, rice, noodles, roasted baby potatoes, and chicken stroganoff.Dessert included cheese cake, apricot/orange cake, coconut blueberry mousse, linzer torte, white choco strawberry mousse, mango milk choco mousse, black forest, golden apricot cake, choco passion mousse, choco mud cake, jamuns and of course, assorted flavors of ice cream.Desserts were a bit underwhelming but the black forest, mousse and ice creams were well put together.I ended the night with a cup of black coffee.Service was prompt and hospitable (as expected).Food - 4/5. Service - 5/5."
4,"Tried their buffet with my team from work. Excellent service and very good food with a lot of variety to choose from. They had a crazy number of options for starters. Main course comprised of different cuisines too. They had some great desserts, but I think they could have done a better job on some of their pastries."
5,"My stay at leela was truly a delight, one of a kind experience. Everything was so classy about the hotel, be it their common area interiors or room decor. The furniture was one of the finest quality I've seen. Also, I got to devour the amazing breakfast they had to offer. Ours was a breakfast buffet but we choose to order in the room only. I ordered Pancakes, waffles, poori sabji, Fresh fruits, Juices, an omelet. Everything was just perfect in taste and I had the best pancakes of my life there. The whipped cream, blueberry Jam, maple syrup and chocolate syrup accompanied with the waffles and pancakes was extraordinary. I would definitely be back soon."
4,Had a great Sunday brunch. Along with a variety of cusines available for the buffet brunch they also have a few live counters where you can order some dishes to your specifications. Good variety of desserts as well.
4,"Was dabbling between places to be able to give my sister the best birthday day breakfast. Landed here after much research. Everything we ate was great. Despite some reviews stating their service, it was good. The continental section has really good selection, the pancakes were fully and light, best I've had in Bangalore. Their baked selection was awesome, must try. Suprisingly their south India fare was beyond expectation. Half of us ate almost all the offerings in that section and it was delightful.Unfortunately I have to agree wrt the communication. We had called in advance and booked for a cake for the bday, they missed this somehow and we had to wait for quite sometime before they got us the cake. However it ended on a sweet note as the cake brought was delicious. I appreciate the gesture even if the missed getting it done earlier.I would definitely visit again and highly recommend the spread."
2,"Had been for lunch on sat 23 March. It has a beautiful ambience and good courteous staff. Place is nice But the choices in the buffet was disappointing for me with the money been paid.The starters were mostly salads in veg and non veg so they were not hot or with masala, the main courses didn't have too much variety. The live counter served Asian stir fry which was good, pav bhaji was disappointing. Desserts were nice with varieties of ice cream, but nothing indian specific like gulab jamun or gajar halwa etc. Didn't provide me the value for money."
5,#Ambiance #food #place #people all sum up and justifies the name #Palace no less than a royal feast for eyes and tummy. Have been going there for quite some time and have never been let down a perfect place for #Bussiness and #Personal space
4,"Great experience I had! Ambience is cool. Service was good. Food is yummy, the quantity is also high So as compared to the price , I would say its worth it! Mocktails are good too. I would suggest you to visit this place atleast once.Ç #happyeating :)"
4,"The best North Indian food in Bangalore. Great ambiance, very good service, we had a buffet, it' was amazing, all dish was very nice, specially North Indian food fantastic, and also dessert menu delicious"
4,"A menu which has a little bit of everything. So engaging a diverse crowd and picky eaters is not a challenge.Service is good, at times the host was a tad too pushy with the wine list. Glad they the had the KRSMA wine in stock, nurtured right here in KarnatakaThe fresh hummus ground once we ordered was perfect. The main course fish were done well. For outdoor seating, they should fire up whatever is required to keep the mosquitoes away as soon as the guests come.Macaroons were good, but could have been lighter."
1,Absolutely disappointing for vegetarians on a grill night buffet. There is nothing for vegetarians other than paneer. Nothing for main course as well. Wasted 3k for absolutely nothing.
5,One of best breakfast buffet spreads in Town!!Amazing food & service this place offers you . The quality of ingredients & products on buffet are outstanding!Quality of fruits on buffet are outstanding & you get a perfect half moon omelette with accompaniment of perfect grill tomato.You should try there multigrain Croissant & Uppam with lamb or egg stew. The way they garnish there Bircher musli with jar.Special thanks to Chef Giri Manni he keep on details on food which is served to customers!I personally will rate this place 10/10.Thanks to Ashish or Akhil who was serving coffee to me!Great food & service! Kudos to Leela Bengaluru!Definitely visit this place again in a week ççç
4,"3.5. Awesome outdoor ambiance, good food, average service. Sums it up...Was here for dinner. Had mezze platter, veg tacos, mozzarella. All three were quite good. Tacos need special mention though. Soft shell and crispy veggies. It was the star of dinner for me. Pricey, as expected being a Leela restaurant."
5,"I took my parents out here for dinner to celebrate their wedding anniversary. The ambience, service and the food was par beyond excellence. We tried chicken angara and manchow soup for starters and both of them were great in taste. For the main course, we had vegetable biryani which was flavourful to bits. The taste and presentation won us over.They also presented a complimentary cake to mark the anniversary celebrations. It was a cute little one and had a fabulous taste.I would definitely love to visit the place again. The service is commendable."
5,"Brilliant place. The buffet spread was so lavish. The ambience is stunning!I was lucky to try buffet with Bangalore local food theme.It is difficult to try all the spread there r so many varieties...The buffet was 1.9k + tax, but worth it.The food is delicious!Both inside and outside seating are great.."
4,I went there on Christmas time and the decoration was splendid. ç We just had Moulin De Gassac Chardonnay by bottle as we were full and on a date. Amazing wine though. Cleanliness was an issue but the ambience made up for that.Visit for the experience Ñö
2,Food - 2/5Ambience - 4/5Service - 3/5Must Try - DessertsClue - Desserts and Salads were really good. But appetisers and main course were not at all good.Need to up the taste in that department.
5,"There are two reasons to rate is an absolute 5 and not just because it is Leela.1. The best North Indian food in Bangalore..my Father in law is a huge critique on this type of cuisine and he said that the chef nailed it...2. The steak was awesome ..may be a few decimal places lower than JW but worth it.Obviously need not have to talk about service and ambiance, it's already understood.Actual Rating - 4.8....prices could have been 10-15% lower and didn't have a Zomato.."
3,"Been to Citrus for lunch. Food tastes good , but there is no much option for vegetarians. Unfortunately the day we went had so much crowd, we waited in long queues."
1,IÇÑm giving one star only for the ambiance. 48 hours later after the buffet I had on 9 December for lunch I had severe food poisoning. My mother in law was very close to getting admitted to a hospital. The barbecue was as cold as a popsicle. Service was kind of ok. Was just wondering if it was the sushi I had. I will never know. Anyway thatÇÑs it for me at citrus
5,Citrus is an excellent buffet place in Leela bangalore. Their spread is really good and well made. Paradise for dessert lovers with sticky pudding and creme brulee.
4,"Went for a team lunch.Ambience: Royal, classy and picturesque.Food: Huge variety to pick from for a buffet. Various cuisines to try.Service: Friendly and courteous staff."
4,Had been here with family for lunch. Ambience is too good. We choose to go to Citrus where they had good spread of buffet.Staff were very friendly and curtegious. We had a good experience but I felt the vegetarian option could have been more and improve on taste. Overall a nice luxury place to dine.
4,The overall experience was good. The ambience and interior was awesome. We ordered biryani which I felt could have been better. The price is also in higher side what we got.
4,"Great Ambience and diverse food options. One star less for the service as we had to keep searching for the waiters. Ordered hummus basket, chicken satay, pizza and spaghetti and the ranking also goes in Same order, Hummus ranking No.1"
5,"Nothing went wrong and simply had an awesome experience with the ambience, food and service. They got enough varieties that you canÇÑt taste everything."
4,Had been here on my wedding anniversary... The ambience was nice but lighting can be worked upon in some of the areas of the restaurant as we were given a table in the corner with light which we felt was less.... Coming to food .. we ordered Bhuney mutter ki seekh which was very nicely prepared.. red thai curry with veggies was beyond expectation and the quantity served was good enough for two.... Not a big hole in pocket and overall a very good and decent experience... Recommended !!
5,"Yet another 5 star. This was our wedding anniversary lunch date, so could not afford a bad experience. A grand spread of buffet covering Indian, Asian, Mediterranean cuisines. All the foods were lip-smacking as usual and as expected! The tender chicken malai kabab was cooked to perfection with perfect mix of mild spices, which was my numero uno! Desserts had a well mix of indian and as well as western items.Service was good. Ambience was stunningly beautiful, has to be as one is inside a palace!Very satisfactory experience."
1,"Went here for Brunch 3rd time... The 1st two experiences were good but the latest one was horrible.Firstly the Menu hasn't changed a bit in last 6 months.The variety and the spread was below average.We like sushi a lot, the ones served here were not good at all... The only saving Grace was smoked Salmon.They have grills as well where they freshly grill meat and stuff. I don't expect a hotel of this category to serve such dry and flavor less meats. It was the driest chicken legs I ever had.. not acceptable from fresh grills.Now on to the drinks, I actually don't know how can someone ruin a Mohito - we had to ask for manager intervention and still the Mohito served was horrible.... it was like having lemon juice at first and later ones were extremely sour... and beers they served was only Kingfisher.. not up to Leela standards at all...Please only have sparkling wine (if you choose that package).. that's the only thing good..About the service - may be it was too crowded for them or a bad day but the service was very bad... Way too much delay in serving and it was like dumping food at the table... Pathetic...The Indian dishes taste horrible too and lack variety...So guys I would suggest to give it a pass until they refresh their Menu and pull up their socks..My next venue to try would be Ritz - The Market.. heard a lot about their spread and service.."
1,Horrible food..all the good reviews are mostly paid and by foreigners..who is not aware of authentic Indian food taste ..waste of money..decent ambiance
5,"The best brunch buffet in Bangalore, bar none. What a beautiful ambiance! I highly recommend that you the the outdoor seating.The buffet is a dessert lover's paradise. The creme brulee, tarts, and bavarois were seriously amazing. Not to take anything away from the savoury items which were awesome as well."
5,"The ambience is cozy and comfortable. I had fantastic company when we visited this restaurant. We were a group of 12-13 people. We were spilt for choices with the variety of cuisines on one menu. The food was gorgeous, every dish we ordered; right from the vegetarian Biryani, the tiger prawns, the rib eye steak with mashed potatoes and pepper sauce, the salmon steak with champagne sauce and Parmesan cheese fries, the Indian breads with fish curry, the tandoori chicken, mutton and vegetables and the rest. The staff were exceptional in their service and were efficient and friendly. The display of some of the most fascinating cakes was a work of art. A wonderful experience indeed."
4," Ambience 4.5 / 5 Food 4/ 5 Service 4.5 / 5Visited Citrus for a Sunday Brunch.. The ambience is very good, specially out door seating. Food is good the spread was excellent. The service was good. Staff were courteous. But when we visited it was crowdy. Would like to visit again."
4,Went there for buffet and it was nice. Loved their food variety. I would really like to go their for their deserts. The hotel for me is very mesmerising. I love this place. The decor is so alluring. Would definitely visit again and again.
4,"Traditional typical five star hotel, as we went from office for a dinner party welcome was so nice, after they made nice table for seating, we ordered starter in veg, after that I took Thai green curry in chicken with roti nan and finally desert in sweet rasmalai was so nice and well, overall the experience was so nice"
3,"When we visit a place like the Leela, which is an iconic hotel in Bangalore, we have really high expectations, and I had reserved this visit for a special occasion. I finally took my family to Citrus for dinner on Sunday for such an occasion. The hotel is gorgeous, and sitting in the patio of Citrus will make you feel like you are in some tropical rainforest. The food, however, was really a disappointment. We ordered the Mulligatawny soup and the Mezze platter for appetizers. I had a salmon steak with Bearnaise sauce, which was really amazing and my 3 stars are solely for the salmon. For dessert, we had the French toast with caramel ice cream which was the most uninteresting dish of the meal. The French toast lacked any unique flavours, and the presentation was quite sloppy. I have never seen my wife not finish a dessert before, but it is sad that the first time had to be at the Leela. In recent times, there has been a boom in amazing new restaurants all over Bangalore, and though Citrus is close to being one of the most expensive ones, it doesn't come even close in terms of uniqueness or taste."
3,"When Life Gives You Lemons, Make Lemon Tart çLocation - Citrus, Leela Palace What is it - Lemon Meringue Tart This tart is filled with a luscious creamy lemon curd that definately wakes your taste buds up. Wish I could see the flaming of the meringue, nevertheless it was a delicious and refreshing snack. Time to go get one yourself çhttps://instagram.com/p/Bn8cAiHBYd8/"
4,The Best Sunday brunch in Bangalore at Leela palace.I have been to many places but this is the one most happening brunch in City.They have live music and live counters scattered around the place. There are grill counter open bar and live pastas.You will enjoy Sunday afternoon with great service and food.
4,I tried the breakfast buffet and been here for dinner as well. Quite a nice place. The food is delicious and the ambience is great. They have a great selection of wine as well.
3,"This is one of the most romantic place in Bangalore. Just love their outdoor seating. It's best to go in the night. Ambiance:They have both indoor and outdoor seating. The indoor is a normal fine dine restaurant. The outdoor is simply superb. The tables are surrounded my plants and the place is lit by fire. Food:I opted for the ala carte menu. The food isn't that great. Don't expect too much.The starters were good compared to the main course.We had ordered vegetable dum biryani, it was horrible. The worst biryani I have ever had. It didn't taste anything like biryani. Very plain and bland.The staff was generous to prepare another biryani but that too wasn't great. Don't order biryani.Å Guava mint mocktailÅ Bhutey mutter ki sheek: this was the best dish.Å Paneer tikkaÅ Alfredo pasta: neither cheesy nor tasty. Over all experience:The food was a huge disappointment. Paying a huge price for such bland food not worth it.Visit this place only if you want to have a romantic and peaceful dinner.The staff was very courteous and professional. I'm giving 3 star only for the ambiance and staff.Ambiance: 4.5/5Food: 2/5Price: 2/5Service: 4/5"
5,These guys had the best Blueberry Cheesecake once upon a time. I don't think they're available but this was the \
5,"Great place to spend some time . Food is great with many varieties Arabian, chinese and Indian. And also live counters pizza, pasta n pav baaji. Well trained staff."
4,"It's been a long that I haven't reviewed a place. So this is what I have got for you all. Citrus, The Leela Palace, Bangalore. The spread is awesome, more than the indian dishes I enjoyed the pan asian and Italian cuisine. The buffet throws you with a choice of amazing salads which you didn't miss. My favourite out of all was the ham salad (I don't really remember the name). There is this one dish from.main course which stole my heart was a crumb fried chicken in tangy tomato sauce. The chicken in served on the sauce which gives you the pleasure to enjoy the crispy chicken when you bit it, and the tangy tomatoes sauce add flavour when u chew it. Gosh, I am salivating now.Coming to a small area where they can really work on is the bakery items. The vanilla sponge, it was very hard and the recipe needs to be worked on. The mousse, please don't beat it too much as the silkyness of a a smooth mousse was missing.For me it is a yes."
5,"Citrus has been ever since The Leela has been around. And in my opinion, dozens of five star hotels have started since then, but there is a unique charm about the hotel and this restaurant now renovated is as good as it can be. The interiors are nice and the space and the ample seating bring in a sense of abundance.Went to the restaurant twice a week ago. Once with colleagues and once with family. The review is based on the last visit with my folks at home.We ordered Mojito and water melon juice for beverages, Hot smoked Chinese char Siu pork ribs and Murgh Angara for starters and the mains were from their grills. Tenderloin steak with sautÉ©ed mushrooms and barbecue sauce.For Desserts, we ordered their ÇìChocolateÇù and ÇìOrangeÇù.The mojitos were really nice and well made. The Water melon juice for my nieces were great too.While Murgh Angara was cooked to perfection and the chicken tasted great, the kids appeared to want all of it for themselves. Good sign!The pork ribs were terrific. The balance of sweet and spices were so nice that we asked the waiter to repeat the order twice! Wasim who took care of it listened to every detail. When we said the second serving somehow had bare bones, he ensured the third order compensated for that with really good ribs.The Steak was fantastic as well. Perfectly cooked meat paired well with the beautifully sautÉ©ed mushrooms and barbecue sauce.The Chocolate (Chocolate Guanaja Gianduja chocolate fudge, salted caramel, hazelnut nougat and dark rum ice cream) is probably the best desserts IÇÑve had off late. While a week ago the fudge was a tad lighter and I could sense an amazing crunch in between, this time was a little denser.But the nougat was fine and the dark rum ice cream was terrific. CanÇÑt write enough of that ice cream. A must have if you fancy alcohol in your dessert.Fascinated I checked what the ÇìGuanaja GiandujaÇù meant in the dessert. Apparently Guanaja is a brand and Gianduia is a sweet chocolate spread containing about 30 % hazelnut paste, invented in Turin about 200 years ago!The orange (Cotton candy cheese cake, peanut butter mango ganache and raspberry sorbet) was really nice too. The cheese cake was perfect, and the sorbet was the best part of the dessert in my opinion.The presentation of both the desserts were excellent.Service was as expected from a place of this stature. Wasim took care of us very well and attended to every little thing including the demands from my 5 year old niece.The only feedback I have for them is about the usage of plastic straws. In fact a lot of gastro pubs have opted for eco-friendly paper based straws.The value is in the whole experience. So you pay for it."
3,"Just a hyped place because of franchise. Food was tasting too ordinary and no efforts were made to check with guest if they were really liking to eat. Found the staff too casual and lazy for a Friday lunch. Though the place was nicely done and had extensive buffet options. Definitely not worth the money paid. ÇìNaam bade, Darshan choteÇù"
4,The ambience was very good. The food was amazing. But it would be good if we have sea food included in the main course and starters as well. 
3,"Lovely place, tried the pizza here. It was not bad, will probably come again and try something different next time. Love the fact that the crust was thin and perfect."
4,The Sunday brunch at the Leela's coffee shop is one of the more happening brunches in the city. Given that Bangalore weather continues to be fantastic even in the afternoon; the sit outs in the verandah and the courtyard are always full.They have live music and live counters scattered across the place; adding to the fair like bustling atmosphere of the place. There are grill counters an open bar and often a live pasta counter. These are of course in addition to the usual counters in the coffee shop inside; where salads; egg counters; India hot food area run against the sushi stall providing for a massive variety for food and drinks.We opted for the full bar brunch and they kept us supplied with endless flowing champagne and the glass seemed to be always full.In the lively and fun environment the only let down has been food. The Leela coffee shop food is never very good. It is of course not bad; just that it is sort of bland characterless average sort of tepid food which is meant to not offend anyone and ends up not being very fun either.The Indian spices are very toned down; the grills are so so in quality of meat and the food leaves you dissastified.If they could fix the food; this place could easily score a 5.Go here for the drinks and environment and don't expect much from the food and you will be okay.
5,If anyone want to have a real killah steak after a night party drive straight to citrus. A must visit place for the steak lovers and wide range of classy delicacies served with mouth watering presentation. And it is real nice to be there during late night outings. You will get a palace to occupy with your gang and a very nice place for taking a selfies too §£§î
5,"Went for a buffet lunch on July 23, 2018. Service was prompt and excellent. Buffet spread was huge and one may require a lot of time to go through it. There are nearly 6 rice items. The spread has range from Continental to Indian then Chinese. I really liked Veg biryani and Fried rice. Desserts, no need to say, it covers a lot than one actually required. I tried all veg desserts and I liked the Rasagulla and Black Forest cake.You may require lot of time to enjoy your food. Early visit is recommended. Have a nice time with your family or friends.This is my second visit. †"
3,"We had lunch there with a couple of drinks. The service was excellent as expected in Leela Palace. We ordered a hummus mezze platter. Overall is was quite good except the tabbouleh which was a bit dull. We had as well a veg pizza. Well, I wonder how such a pizza found its way in this place. I have never had to add so much chili flakes, oregano salt and peppar to cover the lack of taste of a pizza. It made look any pizza chain like a fine dining place."
4,"After citrus underwent renovation this is the first time I have visited. Leela always stands for its quality, standard and class. We went for team buffet to have the lunch experience. All enjoyed the overall experience of this class luxury palace which stays upto itÇÑs mark. They have food spread of different cuisines from Chinese, Indian, Arabic, continental... DonÇÑt have any fav dish to recommend you guys as All were equally good and definitely filling your appetite.Try this place for experience, I am sre you wonÇÑt regret."
4,"Love the spread... deserts are really good..! Starters could be better. But the ambience, service and the overall experience was worth it..!"
4,"The Leela Palace definitely lives up to its name with its ornate and beautiful interiors and ambience. Went to Citrus for their lunch buffet, they had a good spread of choices from Arabian, Indian, Italian and other Western cuisines. The waiters are quite helpful and courteous as well who are well aware about the cuisines and the dishes. Don't forget to leave space for the dessert as there is a lot to choose from to end this satisfying meal."
3,"The leela palace is obviously a beautiful place. So of course the interiors, set up, ambiance is all well. The thing which hit me most was they do not have any insect repellent machines. Post dusk, they encourage people to sit inside because of mosquitoes. And when u ask them, they just provide you odomos. Weird. Food wise, quantity is great. Quality not upto standard. They need to live up to their name and expectations. I hope they take this as a contructive criticism coz places like these definitely need to be the best."
4,Fabulous Food..however lot of dishes where kind of old.. Lots of names was portraying wrong dishes. Loved the Salads and Kheer. Service was good.
4,"This is a review that has been long pending. I make it a point to have the Sunday brunch at the Leela atleast once a quarter and we went last Sunday for their brunch. Once again, Leela has delivered an exceptional time and the food was as always immaculate. Service is beyond expectations and I couldn't have had a more enjoyable time with my family. The live band was pulling out quite a few good numbers and since we were in 'good spirits' we actually started dancing and lo and behold in 5 minutes there were almost 20 - 30 others dancing along. I must say, thanks a lot to the management for not kicking us out. A perfect way to spend a wonderful Sunday afternoon. If anyone asks me how to have a good time in Bangalore on a Sunday, I will point them to the Leela. Keep it up guys."
4,"Went to citrus today for lunch. The buffet spread looked interesting but we had ala carte because we werenÇÑt too hungry. First off the food was fantastic (the wild mushroom pizza was incredible, my friend enjoyed the chicken jalepeno one too). The chocolate dessert was heavenly, super-rich and the dark rum ice cream it was paired with was exceptional. Prices were as expected in a place like Leela. I liked the fact that the silverware was actually silver. But what I didnÇÑt like was that unlike most other 5 stars, this was super crowded and didnÇÑt make for the right ambience to have a good conversation. The tables (esp 2 seaters) are also quite close to each other which is bothersome. The service also left quite a lot to be desired. I can understand that a wood fired pizza might take 40 mins but the dessert also took over half an hour. It was difficult to get the attention of the staff as they seemed more interested in communicating with each other than looking at the guests which is disappointing in a place like Leela Food:5/5 (will go back for sure to try out the buffet)Service:3/5"
1,"We are requested to be polite and friendly whilst writing reviews but when the hospitality and care towards the customer is zero, there is only disappointment one can express. Long story short, I took my family out for a Sunday buffet/brunch at Citrus, Leela today. IÇÑll jump straight into why IÇÑm giving my lunch experience just one star! So to begin with the food wasnÇÑt tasty(the rice preparations were dry and to add to that, none of the Indian curries were worth savouring), the presentation was lousy(Cajun prawn grill in particular when served looked like an absolute mess, with the shell and meat all over the place), moreover the staff took over 30 minutes to get us the check towards the end. No IÇÑm not done yet... so when my grandmother requested for rotis at the start of the meal, the person had to be reminded time and again to bring it to the table... besides all of the above, the cake(of various flavours) which was a part of various dessert options was dry and lacked moisture of any kind. I can go on and on, and the last straw was when I eventually mentioned to the person in charge of giving us the bill, that they had delayed us for no reason, he conveniently suggested that we were writing something in the review form and hence the delay in bringing us the bill. The review/feedback form hardly took me a minute to fill, because I was ticking the same boxes for all questions. I wish I could be more loving in my review, but that would mean IÇÑd have to alter the truth. CanÇÑt do that. Disappointing experience overall and IÇÑm never visiting again. ItÇÑs sad because the last time I visited Citrus a few years ago, I had a blast."
4,"Buffet spread was never ending, there were countless options from every cuisine. The best part I just loved was deserts section. Look at the pics and you will know. It's a must visit for folks who love deserts."
4,"wide range of food in lunch buffet. quality wise not bad. but taste is not that appreciable. overall experience is good. good hospitality. though it is very expensive compared to the taste of food,still would like to go again to enjoy the ambiance"
5,"We went here a few months ago on a Sunday for their Brunch buffet.They had a fantastic spread, loads of options and I particularly loved the desserts.A special mention for the pasta, which was outstanding."
5,"Ambience was just awesome , may be the leela effectû.the staff were really helpful..had such huge spread of starters, mains and dessert that one will be confused of where to start from... just loved it..."
5,"Today I have been to Citrus, It was an official lunch Ñ ç¥. It was an amazing and finger licking  experience.FOOD : I will start with Desserts ç® as I felt so happy Ç to taste and have so many flavours. Highlighters were Mango Tart, pie ß and chocolate brownie ç . Variety n taste of breads were really good. I personally liked Veg Noodles, chicken çî & mutton curry. Watermelon ç Juice was really refreshing, fresh n soothing. AMBIENCE: it was mesmerising, full of greenery. Perfect place for date, lunch or dinner.Overall a great experience çèª. I would definitely recommend and visit this place again."
5,The food ambiance was simply amazing. We went to citrus they had one of the best outdoor sitting arrangements done. I had the best panner Tika of my life. Lemonade was not good can be improved.For main course again panner was simply amazing. They can improve on the speed of service as most of us were waiting for the nan after starters and having the drinks.It was a experience worth visiting once.
4,"Good place, good food vareity, good presentation, nice ambeince...friendly staff..the stay at the hotel was good, excellent service..I had no issues with the staff...good service..value for money..........................................................................................osum!!"
3,"An office dinner with some very senior people was arranged here. While we were pretty excited to be at the Leela Palace, the Citrus did not live up to our expectations Ç the spread was rather limited and lacked a theme. The desserts were not great either, particularly the kaala jamun, which was so hard as if it was a little too old. Although the service was very good, the ambience was very ordinary. And to make things worse for us, we were seated behind the oven, which made it unbelievably hot and stuffy. All in all, it was an experience that we didn't really cherish."
3,"Extravagant place to treat your mentor for a farewell lunch a huge spread on various cuisines.Ç North Indian, Continental, Thai, Chinese etc etc. Tasted each and every dish including many dessertsBut if the question is, if i would return? Then my answer will be,Ç No.Ç Other than spending 1700+tax there was no dish that imprinted on me that reminds of \"
4,I recently went for a team dinner here. The restaurantÇÑs ambience is very good and food is also pretty nice. There were many options in both vegetarian and non vegetarian food. I liked the shrimp and fish in starters. Main course was decent with many continental options. Desserts were major attraction for everyone in my team. It was loved by everyone. I heard the breakfast buffet here is good so anyone who wakes up early during weekends should try this place.
4,Went there for lunch and I must say the ambience was nice and the staff was extremely polite. The drinks were fine and the food was super healthy and tasty. The non vegetarian dishes here were fabulous.
5,"IÇÑd go back to citrus how many ever time i can. The best buffet in town, my fav is the outdoor seating....and I can spend a few good hours there. someone does the hummus well next to Byblos. Thank you!"
5,Amazing ambience and very polite and professional staff!!!:) I would highly recommend this place to all:)Highly and truly a worth place to go with ur loved onesù§Øè†
3,"Went here on a Friday night with my team with prior booking. We wanted to opt for the buffet but they don't have buffet on Friday nights. Started with ordering wine, a few beers and mocktails. For starters we ordered the tandoori chicken tikka,methi fish, chicken Satay, veg kabab and baby corn fritters.(I don't remember the exact names of the dishes). The chicken satay was the best starter, everything else was pretty average considering the quality,quantity and price.Coming to the main course, we ordered the mushroom pizza, aurbegine red sauce pasta, mushroom cream fettuccine, chicken steak, chicken pasta with tomatoes, paneer makhani and naan to go with it. The pizza was thin crust and one of the best pizzas I've had. The pastas were tasty and the portions were sufficient for one person. The fettuccine was my favourite dish from the night. The paneer makhani and naan were so so, I'd give it a miss the next time I go here.For desserts, we ordered the passion, chocolate rum cake with ice cream, indian dessert platter and a caramel sauce dessert( can't remember the exact name). The desserts are so so, not great. You can order the cakes from the bakery on display, which taste way better than the desserts on the menu.Ambience is the highlight of this place, it's beautifully lit and they've an outdoor seating which reminds you of a bonfire.The service is ok, they can work on their speed as it took forever to bring water or even cutlery.Overall a nice place to go to, do order the pizza and mushroom sauce pasta."
3,"We visited the place on a lazy Sunday afternoon and chose to order ala-carte instead of the buffet. They do a pretty good job with Italian, food is yum. Beverages were okay though.On service, being a premier 5star they should definitively improve their services. The place looked understaffed and did not do justice to the premium-ness they charge for.Ambience was good, we preferred outdoor seating over the indoor chilling one.All in all, a decent place."
4,"It was awsm experience . Hospitality ., Customer handling and space at its best, enjoyed a lotEnviroment soothing for cpuple as well as others.Best place at reasonable price...."
3,Ambience was really nice but the food was not upto the mark.Expectations are not met.But for a change you can visit once. Good for romantic dinners
4,"Loved the place , staff and food. A must go restaurant not just for a business meet but also for a personal special event!!Ç Enjoyed every dishÇ , Pickled Pine apple was outstanding . Most of items were actually mild in spice which might be because of there global clients . The feel of being in THE LEELA takes over the food."
4,"Was staying in Leela Palace for 2 days and both the days Citrus served me good breakfast. Tried their breakfast buffet and it was awesome. It had almost everything. Idli, vada and other South Indian food? Yes. Aaloo paratha? Yes. Waffles and pancakes? Yes. Omelettes? Yes. Bakery products, cereals, freshly cut fruits and beverage? All yes. ö So had a great time there. Food tasted very good and the staff were helpful."
4,Went for an office event. Good food with of course great place and area they have maintained. Could add more items on the buffet list. Otherwise everything was perfect.
4,Went for a lunch buffet. The place had a good ambience and service was upto the mark. Well the beverage was not so good. Starters and Main course were okay. Too many options for desserts which too was okay. Liked the live music.
3,The staff courtesy was top notch. Breakfast was dissappointingOver all a quality drop as per food quality. Last two year decline I feel. Croissant was really bad..section felt poor.
4,Great ambience and wonderful service. Have to mention about Monty and his other team members who really went out of their way to serve us post hours of closing . Banana caramel ice cream here is out of the world . Preeta Fernandes .
4,oh what a hugggee spread..loved the pizza and desserts.cheese cake was to die for.the right proportion of sweet.great place to be with family.
3,"We booked a team lunch for 15 at Citrus. We were guided to table as we reached. A huge spread unfortunately we couldnÇÑt find any wow factor in any dish. Service was not great . You need to call staff and all seems to be overloaded . No happy faces there . Average food and service , which is not expected from Leela"
4,"Excellent food, hell lot of options. Enjoyed buffet thoroughly. Equally distributed for veg and nonveg, usually in buffets will have less items but here its good. Definitely will go many times."
5,"This place is beautiful, lovely ambience. Super helpful staff. Awesome decor, you can totally feel Xmas. Service is great. Quite a few options for dining/quick bites. Great place for meetings/corporate events too. Indoor and outdoor options available. Lovely lobby. Would highly recommend visiting it."
4,"I visited citrus on a Thursday night which is supposed to be their grill night. I loved the whole decor and ambience given that it is the holiday season. They had gingerbread and Christmas theme cakes displayed around a gigantic Christmas tree. Citrus is a buffet restaurant at the Leela and I really liked most of the dishes. I tried the tenderloin steak, chicken tangdi and lamb chops which were delicious and perfectly cooked. I however wished they had some pork chops as well. The salads were fresh and light. I liked the salmon and the grilled fish the best from their wide variety. The corn and spinach soup was simply delicious with the right balance of flavours. Their pizzas our freshly made right in front of you in an open oven with fresh toppings but I felt the base was a little too tough. The chicken fricassee was the dish of the night for me. Rich, creamy and delicious bits of chicken and peppers with tenderly cooked mushrooms. I also loved the melugu Koli from the Indian section. The desserts were fun and I chose the baked yoghurt and pannacotta which were pretty good but werenÇÑt the best."
4,"It's a great place to be for a lunch buffet. Awesome spread starting from starter, main course and deserts. I specifically liked the deserts. Take your time, stroll around the entire restaurant, choose your type of food and enjoy. Lot to choose from."
4,The lunch buffet was a wide spread of veg and non veg which are very tasty. A mention about their desserts and a special about chocolate based ones were awesome.
3,Well we went there for a Sunday brunch.....but the appetizers were pretty cold although they tasted good.....desserts were really bad pls work on them...Even if there is one dessert let it be top notch.. ...pizzas and fresh bakes r a must try...French toast in particular ...and oh I forgot abt the freshly squeezed fruit juices - ultra love for that :*
4,"My first visit to Citrus.. thought of trying only vegetarian dishes today (except of course for the desserts ;p). Tried almost all Mediterranean and East Asian veg dishes.. absolutely loved it. The starters and the main course we're all good. To top it all almost all the desserts were fantastic. The service was very good. The half star goes for two reasons..1. not all desserts had tags, 2. Phirni and more desserts (didn't get the name) were a bit wanting.. but overall a definite must visit.."
4,"Well I tried a couple of things which were pretty good. I like the whole palace building of this hotel. But the Burger I ordered and the cake were nothing even close to special or cake even ok for that matter, so maybe something needs to be done in that area.Otherwise it's definitely a good pleasure to be in Leela for a meal and relax.Did I mention I loved their Pizza? It is definitely a great try."
4,"Been here on my 18th birthday.A perfect place for fine dinning.The interior decor and seating arrangements were perfect.On that day street food festival was going on,there was a lovely collection of street foods from different parts of India. To my utter surprise they arranged for a special birthday cake for me.I was totally taken away by their gratitude and service.Would love to be here in the upcomming days."
3,"Not impressed with the buffet. It is the same for months and common folks who serves Basa fish. Even small time eateries serve Bekti/Asian Sea Bass. Please set some standard. No biriyani, instead Tomato rice... I mean seriously guys."
5,"Excellent menu, a lot more main dishes to be added for the vegetarians though. But taste was on point, worth every penny that you give them. Hospitality is amazing, the chefs and waiters are friendly Ç. Good job guys keep it up. Would definitely visit again"
4,Citrus - I have been to this place n no of time. The ambiance is perfect. The foods are amazing. Biryani is the best. The staffs are realy polite and humbel. They realy know how to handel there guest.
4,"I have been to Citrus for their incredible weekend breakfast.To start off with the location is prime. You can sit inside or outside (definitely recommend the latter). The spread is fantastic spread with 3 live counters (Indian, Italian and Chinese). I'd definitely urge to try out the eggs benedict (it's quite a mouthful) from the live counter. Lots and lots of fruits (including kiwis). The entire menu would probably comprise of 60+ items.Ç Definitely worth going!"
3,"Been here for a dinner buffet on a weekday. Relatively less occupied. What's good - The ambience- moment you enter the lobby you can feel the luxury. We preferred to sit inside. Music is soft, won't disturb our conversations.Service is very good as expected.Quality of food. What's was not impressiveThe items in main course and desserts were relatively less compared with other good buffet options available elsewhere.  How's food - The day we happened to visit was a grill night. Taste wise, some dishes were just Ok and some were good. Overall, desserts were the most I enjoyed. Starters and non veg salads had good spread. In order of priority - Ambience , Service and Food Bottom Line - You pay the price for luxury. "
4,"We went on a team lunch some days back. I was of the opinion that like many other 5star (n above) restaurants, Citrus- The Leela Palace would also offer an average spread of buffet n the taste would be just so so. But to my surprise, it had one of the best spreads (a huge one) n quality/ taste of the food was also not comprised at all. Loved it"
1,Very average food. And found a cockroach crawling in the cold cuts section. And the pastries section is very bland.Somehow the joy in the food is missing.
1,"I visited Leela on 4th August, Friday night since we had a sudden craving for desserts and it was already quite late (11:30 p.m.). Leela was the only option nearby and we were definitely not complaining until we reached there. When we entered Citrus, there was no one to usher us in ask for our preference of the table. We were aimlessly looking around trying to find someone to ask for a table for 3. But it looked like the waiters were too occupied (By the way, only 4 tables had guests, rest were empty). We couldn't seat ourselves in the empty tables because none of them were cleaned after the last guest had left and had half filled glasses. We walked out to the outdoor seating area and still no one came to take our order. After waiting for almost 10 mins, I went out to call someone to take our order and a waiter was sent. While we were waiting for our food, we noticed a cat loitering around in the dining area. To our shock, it jumped on one of the tables and was licking the glasses and the plates. We were appalled at the hygiene standards being maintained by a hotel of this stature. After we had our desserts, again we had to go and call someone to give us the bill. That took so long that we actually walked up to the place where the waiter was getting our bill printed to pay the money. And when we complained about the cat licking the cutlery, the staff could not careless and just stayed quiet with an \"
4,"We were there for the brunch on Sunday. We selected the sparkling wine option which included food, they offered a wide range of food, though my personal favourite was the sushi bar. The dessert selection was also pretty impressive."
3,The buffet has multiple cuisines to offer but I did not quite like the north indian main course. Not the kind of variety a northie looksn for. Live pizza counter was great. I liked the pizza. Desserts were amazing. There was a lot of variety. Ambience is really nice. We went on a lunch. The hotel of course is beautiful.
4,"Breakfast @ Citrus is a delight. They have a huge buffet spread constituting all Indian and Continental delights, fresh cut fruits, cold pressed juices, fresh juices, milk shakes and fresh coconut water as well. But basic tea/coffee is a bit disappointing (-0.5 only for that). Start your day with healthy and yummy food and satisfy your dear hungry tummy!"
4,"The best buffet lunch you could have among five stars and I'm not kidding. A spread too big to try everything. I especially remember going for thirds of shawarma and oh, the dimpsums too! Don't miss out on this lunch buffet. û"
4,"C I T R U SSSSSSSSSSS...Lovely Setting - Spacious - Outdoor & Indoor - Great Service - Amazing Variety of Food - Elegant!This is a lovely place to wine and dine, whatever time of the day it be... the breakfast is cool, the brunches are lively and chic and the dinner is quite & satisfying!The Brunch has an outdoor bar with delectable drinks, including wine & champagne... try the youthful Mojito and the refreshing tanqueray based cocktail...Try the live grill station...badami chicken tikka, grilled lamp... very succulent and tasteful......and the variety goes on and on ... from the Breads section, South Indian, North Indian, Asian, Chinese, Italian and the unmissable Deserts section! The service is quick and sharp... the stewards are polite, very very hospitable and maintain truly 5 star Leela Standards!!!Overall, amongst the best brunches in town!"
3,"I had been here for team lunch. The menu was wide but completely scattered. I did not like the dishes that day. Also, for vegetarians it can be clumsy as non-veg and veg are placed side by side. During mango season, there were no mangoes in the fruits section. Desserts were good. What I loved more than food is the ambience. 5/5 for ambience and 2.5/5 for food."
5,It was the best experience. Wide variety of choices and luscious desserts. Hospitality was great! They also have live music. A perfect Sunday brunch.
3,"Was here for dinner with family and was very disappointed. Being Leela was expecting much more. When asked if we could sit out in patio they asked are you comfortable with mosquitoes, really?!Ambience was like an average restaurant and food was ok too. Wouldn't recommend spending so much money especially if planning for dinner. There are plenty of better options out there. 3 starts only for the amazing desserts they have on menu!"
4,"Awesome place to have breakfast buffet, usually there are lot of food options available, at times they prepare food for you on request as well. Sit on the outside to enjoy the early morning warmth along with great food."
4,"Good ambiance and choice of food available, the staff is \"
5,"Absolutely brilliant!My sister and I met a friend here over their breakfast buffet. I don't even know where to start. The variety is immense and the quality and tastes are over the moon. I was honestly on cloud 9 with their continental variety so let me tell you what I ate because I can't well remember the number of dishes they had there. I tried the bacon, breakfast sausages, ham and egg bake which is served in the cutest little skillet, breakfast ham, french toast which was rich with raisins and candied fruit and very cinnamony, the bread and butter pudding, baked beans, grilled broccoli, foul mandamus, mashed potatoes which were a tad bit too salty. They have an omelette and a waffle counter where you can you can customize those to your taste. There was a pastry counter with the bread and fresh croissants and danishes. another counter had fresh fruit and veggies and your regular cereals and yoghurts. There was fresh juice, freshly made and served in little bottles labelled with watermelon, pineapple and orange.Ç The Indian food counter had both south Indian and north Indian varieties and their dosa with an assortment of chutneys is to die for. I was really impressed. The Chinese counter I did not touch but I noticed a pretty good variety there as well. Since I am a breakfast person, this really put me in breakfast heaven. It is well worth a try and you will not be disappointed.The service is a tad bit slow but still very good. All in all, I love this place!"
3,"In our culinary sojourn of Sunday brunch, Easter on the 16th April17 Ç was the turn for Citrus at the Leela Palace1) Food: As far as taste goes this hands down beats anything we have had in Bangalore (Westend, Windsor Manor, Vivantas). The spread was smaller than equivalent places - the taste made more than made up for it. Albeit the difference in desserts was not observable, The piece the resistance was the Sushi and the Chilli Garlic prawns. Across the board the food was well prepared with fresh ingredients. Though the ice creas was so so. Can't give any thing less than 5 stars2) Ambience: We were given a place outside, it was hot (bangalore is exceptionally hot this summer) and noisy ( we hate the live band every where) and it was crowded. We never felt comfortable - we had to circumnavigate other tables to reach the spread. I would rate 4 stars - purely acknowledging the fact that it was hot and a festive sunday. On any other day we would rate 3.3) Service:S Being a top of the end property the service couldn't be worse.Ç a) We had called up previously inquiring if the Nearbuy vouchers were valid and we were informed twice that yes they are valid. At arriving on first inquiry - the person didn't revert back. Once we had started, we inquired again to be informed that today is a special lunch and the vouchers are not valid. We were promised that the vouchers would be adjusted. At the end they were not adjusted after some argument some adjustment was made but not to our satisfactionb) The drinks were never served on time, in most cases we had to talk at least two timesc) Similarly barbecue, the order of chili garlic prawns never arrived, Ç on visiting the booth second time, some other prawns were sent. When we went again figuring out what is the deal, the person said that it has been sent to the table, he said he will make it again. And again started making the regular prawns. On telling that this is not Garlic prawn - it told that they were finishedd) We kept The Easter bunny with the service staff, since it had started melting, while leaving the bunny was not founde) We ordered for coffee, which again never arrived - we waited a good 15 minutesClearly the place is setup for expats, who don't mind paying 4K per personÇ Can't give more than 2 stars4) Value for money: It is probably the most expensive brunch in the town, probably higher than even Westend (where we get 25% cashback as inner circle). Given the total experience we would rate it about 3.5"
5,A perfect place overall. I had visited the place many times. Initially we used to attend our team meeting here. Later I found that place perfect for my dinner buffet with my family. Loved it! Food was awesome and the degree of hospitality is amazing.
4,"Spent a Sunday noon here, the brunch was a variety of cusines.. They had good activities to keep the kids occupied.. I would recommend this place for a lazy Sunday brunch.. My favorite here was the sushi bar!"
5,"Came here for a team lunch on a weekday and I was literally like ç when I saw the number of dishes they had, especially the desserts.We took the outdoor seating facing the beautiful garden.There were more than 10 different options each for vegetarians and non-vegetarians for starters, salads, main course and desserts. There's just soooo much food that you'll feel you're not doing justice because you cannot possibly taste all that they have to offer.They had almost all kinds of cuisines, ranging from Italian to Asian, North Indian and South Indian, English breads and the dessert section was a treat for the eyes and palette.My favourite had to be the Asian and Indian section. Simply loved pretty much everything I tasted there.There were around 15 desserts and I could taste only size of those because I was way too full. The sugar levels in all the desserts was so subtle, just the way I like it, which allowed the other flavours to stand out like matcha and pistachio, orange, mango in the mango cheesecake, strawberry in the strawberry tarts, to name a few.Even the ice creams were smooth and tasted very good, unlike icey icecreams in other buffets.They even had a live woodfire pizza counter and the pizzas were sooooo good, loved it!The drinks they had were so refreshing and so unique.I've heard a lot about their Sunday brunch which I'd love to try.Totally worth it! "
3,With great expectations of wonderful variety of dishes and brilliant hospitality I booked a table at Citrus a brand name tagged to \
1,"INHUMANE TREATMENT. I have been dining at Leela for 30 years, and their restaurant in Mumbai, but never have experienced such barbaric behavior ever before at a restaurant. The reviews are correct about the poor service--mine was jut terrible from every Leela Bangalore employee. I had taken their Sunday Brunch, and Jyothika, the hostess was clueless about the menu and anything else about the restaurant,Ç and became dominating for no reason.Ç I asked for a specific plate to be made, as I have had it before, but Deepak, the restaurant manager lied and said there were no ingredients, because suddenly their industrial kitchen has no ingredients! No one waited at my section or table, and I had to constantly get up and find someone on the other corner of the restaurant.Ç I finally told Deepak the manager of why is there so much difficulty because I am spending more time wasting to find someone to place an order, and instead of helping, he grew hostile.Ç He started gossiping and backbiting with his employees, and it was visible.Ç The food even took more time--my masala tea took 25 minutes for it to come to my table.Ç The food that finally came was exactly the how the other reviews have described--mediocre and not at a 5-star level.Ç I got to a point with the passive-aggressive behaviour, the silent treatment, to the incompetency, poor managerial and customer skills that I just walked out.Ç I wrote to the General Manager, Mr. Kunal Chauhan, who never responded to my email.Ç I tried to reach him by phone and was told his secretary, Ms. Mary would contact me in 30 minutes. She never did.Ç I had to reach out to the again, and Ms. Mary never apologized for not fulfilling her commitment and grew self-righteous. Mr. Chauhan said he would write back to me, but since February 18th, he has not.Ç This is how bad Leela Bangalore is! This also reinforces the passive-aggressive behaviour of not responding, the silent treatment, not taking any responsibility, and backbiting to erase the experience of the customer.Ç It wasn't just about hospitality and service, but this is completely inhumane to behave this way.Ç And, it reflects on the very top--Mr. Chauhan, his secretary, Ms. Mary, and across departments, including Citrus with Jyothia and Deepak--they haveÇ a way to respond only by primitive means.Ç DO NOT COME HERE.Ç You are wasting your personal time, travel time, manner of respect and actually a humane experience.Ç This place sadly has such poor integrity and behaviours. There are many good restaurants and luxury hotels that reach a standard of humane and hospitable treatment."
4,"Been to citrus @ Leela , had ordered for katti roll & watermelon juice , food was delicious , nice ambiance ,staffs were courteous, had a good time.."
2,"Being Leela, the taste of the food here should have been much better. Service was below average. Food was served at room temperature. We ordered Indian plus some oriental/chinese items. All items tasted average. We can get the same taste food at any average Bengaluru restaurant. Citrus Ambience was also a let down compared to similar Bangalore hotels."
1,Completely disappointing place to go & have dinner !! The choices are very limited and even lot of food items tasted stale. The price and taste has no match.
5,"We had a exquisite lunch yesterday at Citrus , Ç Retheesh did a wonderful job taking care of our table..Ç he was prompt and always on top of all our needs. Ç I celebrated my Sons birthday there and it was a lovely experience. Ç The Kids enjoyed it !!"
4,"Absolutely love their Sunday brunches. Unlimited food and drinks with your friends makes it perfect place to unwind after a hectic week of work. They have a very good spread of food. Though over the period of years I have seen reduction in the variety like king prawns, oysters etc. But still I'd definitely recommend this."
3,"There is absolutely no doubt that the option listÇ at the citrus is very big. However if i had to look at the options we had for an indian vegetarian, i would say i was quite disappointed.. The items that i had were lemon rice, dry potato curry, brinjal curry, moong dal chilka, pav bhaji.. Thats it..The lemon rice was good - light preparation, easy to digestBrinjal curry was not good.. Felt bland.The moong dal chilka was a light preparation.. Tasted good with lemon rice.Pav bhaji was good too.. The bhaji was a live counter.. Heated fresh with butter.I felt overall the food taste was overall good but not excellent..The buffet layout was extremely confusing.. This needs to be organized better with all veg main course on one side and all non veg on another..The desserts had a big variety of cakes of all sorts and a few \"
5,"Trust me this place is amazing!! They have one of the most amazing buffets. Had been here on 24th December and the buffet spread was huge, especially the desserts were delicious. We were given a special private dining section for my family which we really enjoyed. The staff were very courteous and helpful. There attitude towards service was very professional. Can't recall the name of the staff who was in charge for our table, but he sure did his job really very well. Special applause to the team who really took care of us during our lunch. We will surely visit this place again!!"
3,"Veg Buffet reviewStarters : Paneer tikka & Tandoori Gobi, both were at room temperature and not that great at taste.Chinese : Sweet chili baby corn was good and so was the noodles and fried rice.Pizza: None of the 7/5 stars restaurant can make it. Bland and disappointing as ever.Main Course : None of the veg curries were that great although the yellow daal was tasty.Naan was good.Dessert : The praline n almond, Mango and Vanilla were very good. The rasogulla was also very tasty.Service : I was sitting outside and the service was kind of look out for them and call out. Really disappointed with the service.I had been to Leela twice, Jamavar and Citrus, I really feel the service needs a push.Most of the business hotels offer far better service than this.\"
4,"I love their Sunday brunch...pick an outdoor seating, their band plays some peppy numbers for a midday meal..one of the best sangrias I've had in a long time..sip away at leisure..service is slow but who's in a rush when on a Sunday brunch..there's multiple things for kids to do here- bouncy castle, rock wall..v lively place! Options in food are plenty but quite consistent every Sunday!"
4,"Had been here on Sunday, found the place very interesting. Service was good, they did help us find a table at outside lawn on request. Menu is quite a spread with Indian n Continental dishes. We ordered Lebanese grill which was awesome. Other was Smoked salmon in appetisers which was also nicely done. Overall good experience."
5,"We were at the Citrus Restaurant - Leela Palace for a Sunday Brunch. Opted for the Brunch with Unlimited beverages option. The ambiance was stunning. There are 2 seating options. 1) In the Garden 2) The royal interior space. We could feel the luxury every where in the restaurant. The food spread was brilliant. Starting from the very Indian Biryani to the Japanese cuisine, every thing was available. The wine and the cocktails were simply amazing. One of the best fine dining experience in Bangalore. If you are sure of paying more than 3k for a brunch, look no further. There is always a probability to meet some celebrity. I did meet one!"
1,"Went here for dinner and was utterly disappointed. We had ordered 2 appetizers and a pizza. Firstly, it took 40 minutes for the food to come as the servers and chefs took their own sweet time. Secondly, the pizza came before the appetizer which is completely backwards. Along with this, they completely forgot one of the appetizers and said they would bring it 20 minutes after the pizza. Thirdly, we had asked for a vegetarian green papaya salad, but they brought it with shrimp even though we had specifically put in a special request. And for some reason they had dumped a ridiculous inedible amount of soy sauce into the salad. Papaya salads do not have soy sauce and this place seriously needs to learn portion control.I am extremely dissatisfied and genuinely mortified by the lack of good service and food. I highly doubt I would ever go back."
4,They have the most amazing breakfast spread. One must start by choosing from the exotic range of fruits and juices. The Lebanese counter offers delicious food. The pancakes and other confectionaries are drool worthy. The salads were average. The service deserves an applause. The outdoor seating is beautiful.
4,Went there yesterday for Sunday Brunch. Amazing buffet spread with variety of cuisines to choose from. Great ambiance and soothing live music.
3,"If you opt for Al a carte, the service is very slow. You will have to surely close your eyes on the price section otherwise you will end up ordering limited and less quantity."
4,1. Mind readers 2. Understand meaning of \
4,"Good food, variety, staff is courteous. Overall good experience, only thing not up to the mark was indian desserts, skip them. Ambience is relaxed and nice."
5,"Wow!! What an experience..Been to Citrus for Colleagues 5 year Completion . Perfect Ambiance, Courteous Staff and loads of Food. Ç You name it, they have it. The Lunch buffet is vast, i bet no one can have everything here. Its awesome. The starters and Mains are included with all cuisines like Thai, Chinese, Tan-door and Pizzas are awesome. They best part is desserts and Ice creams. Oh God..can't wait to be there again."
4,"This beautiful place had always mesmerized me with its amazing hospitality , and grandeur. This time, I was attending the exclusive preview of their ÇStreet Food Festival'. If you have a question in your mind, about how exactly can Street Food look and seem to be so special, you are in for a surprise(pleasant one) here :)A carefully curated menu that pulls out the best of Street delicacies from various parts of India, and puts forth a platter of Sheer happiness. Who ever thought that Street food could be so amazingly served, plated and that too keeping the memory of those close to heart tastes intact, in fact, notching them up one more step..We started our gastronomic experience with the beautiful Rose Lassi which came in a Kullad, topped with white butter. Rich, thick and just the perfect dose of sweetness, this is Ç a great summer time saviour. Others tried the tender coconut water, which is just a natural bliss.I started off munching the Indian snacks on the table(Rose cookies, banana chips and murrukkus), followed by the Dhokla! and was clean bowled by the softness of it, with flavour dripping from each bite. Reminded me of old days when that was a favourite snack in my tiffin box :)Next comes the chaat platter, starting with the Palak Paan ki Chat, this unique dish is made with batter fried spinach/palak and adding up flavors of Paan to give it a twist. All this with some sweetened yoghurt, with coriander and pomegranate garnish. Next is Rajkachori, which is a North Indian speciality. It is a savoury item with a filling of different namkeens, topped with curd, and chutneys with a topping of fresh coriander, Sev and pomegranate. When this had set the mood for the day, next I tried the Murgh ka Chat, which was my personal favourite. Diced chicken, well marinated and cooked with subtle spices, and diced potatoes to go with it, topped with coriander and pomegranate garnish. Now we head for some South Indian street food delicacies, starting off with the Kotthu Paratha(veg & non-veg, later being my favourite), which is a Tamil dish of mincing and mashing the chicken and paratha repeatedly. The Egg Dosa with Bheja Fry was next, and me not being a bheja fan, let it go. My other friends who tried it there, loved it totally though..Next lined up were, Golli Bajji, Nethhili fry, and Jheenga Koliwada(Oh I gorged on these beautiful spiced prawns platter).After that, straight from the Indian Sigree section, we were treated to some Awesome Quail roast, Pathar ka Gosht & Beef Phal. The marination, the texture and the amazing taste of these told the stories of patience which goes in the making. Each of them being a slow cooking dish, had flavors in each bite. I loved the Pathar ka Gosht more, which is a popular lamb dish, from Hyderabad, prepared with mutton by heating it on a wide stone, on a flame and adding up spices later once the meat is cooked.Ç I was almost full by this time, but the sight of the main course made my eyes and taste buds glitter and dance with joy! It was Idiyappam which is also known as Semige/Noolputtu, which is made up of rice flour pressed into a thread form and steamed. This paired with the beautiful Paya Korma, which traces its roots back to Mughal cuisines, is a dish where meat or vegetables are braised with water, stock, and yogurt or cream are added for that creamy texture. It was just perfect!We also tasted the Baida Rotis, which is a popular Street food delicacy from Mumbai. Baida Roti is a shallow fried indian bread stuffed with minced mutton or chicken depending on the choice preferred. Its awesome and delicious combination of mutton and eggs rolled in a crispy roti. Couldn't have more of this as we were just saving place for Dessert. :PAhh! And the stars of the menu, desserts come over..Just the sight of them makes us drool. It was hot jalebis with Badam Milk, accompanied with Kulfis! Yes, we had this all. :)After all of this, we finished our meal in true Bangalorean spirit , with a cup of Filter Coffee, or Kumbakonam Degree Coffee as they called it.Ç It was in total an amazing food journey, with full marks to taste.Taste & Quality: 4.5/5Service & Hospitality: 5/5The Street Food Festival is on from Sept 1st to Sept 11th. Go there and get yourself hosted by one of the finest fine dines, and it shall be a journey of luxury, style and flavor in all forces to make it a lovely memory!"

4,"Street food has always excited me ever since I was a child. What according to you is Street Food? Junk food you get on the streets, right? Not anymore!. You got me right, Citrus @ The Leela Palace brings an exclusive street food festival from the streets of India to your plate. ThatÇÑs not it. The variety of delicacies are huge, I bet you canÇÑt afford to miss this Royal treat. As rightly said, good things comes in small packages.

3,Visited here long long ago and tasted cakes in here..!! But recent visit was a part of Street food fest preview..!! Felt more interesting after chefs introduction about the fest..!!! Looking forward..!!

3,Few times i been here for breakfast and lunch buffet place is ok but quite small spread is ok too this looks like designed to accomidate hotel guests rather than dine out ppl. But you will find enough stuff to fill ur breakfast
5,"The best place for brunch in Bangalore! The champagne and sushi is my fave and our kids love the pizzas. They are always ensuring you have enough to eat, drink and that everyone is happy. Live music in the background is great and the activities for kids are a bonus. Great value for money and a gorgeous location. Would recommend for sure íèª"
4,Such lavish restaurant..the brand stands true to its class..ambience is just so very apt..it attracts mainly posh crowd as it is for high budget customers..
3,"Citrus...Been there yesterday after ages. Good food. Ordered the following:Guava based Mocktail Mulligatawny SoupFoccacia Chilli Cheese ToastRed Curry With VegetablesAlso tasted Paneer TikkaTarkari Dum (Veg) Biriyani Guava based Mocktail - Good. The soup inspite of insisting it be hot, was served warm. However upon my feedback, it was taken back and served hot. The soup was good. Foccacia Chilli Cheese Toast - 4 small pieces served with French fries and a small portion of Salad - this was very good. Chewy and Cheesy. For main course I ordered the Thai Red Veg Curry which was served with Jasmine rice. I simply loved this. Cooked to perfection the flavour lingered through the evening. Paneer Tikka - was very good but the Paneer was nowhere close to the \"
4,"The breakfast has a good selection of food variety and service is exceptional.A very good ambience with indoor, semi outdoor a d outdoor seating with lush green areas.The food is tastefully prepared and served with grace.I have to mention their idlies are one of the softest I have tasted but chutneys need some work."
3,"Citrus is located at the ground floor of leela palace, old airport road. As the restaurant is inside a 5star hotel parking is taken care of. The review is based on the lunch buffet i visited. It is a hugely spread buffet with a wide variety of cuisines to choose from and definitely not pocket friendly. The place is well suited for team and family gatherings. The interior is peaceful and neatly done with rich furnishings but was way too much noisy during my visit. We were offered a table outside as we wanted to stay away from the crowd and also due to lack of seating arrangement for a huge crowd of 25people inside. The buffet had no special starters or main course which isn't included elsewhere in Bangalore. A variety of salads , live counter is worth mentioning. I loved the prawns here. Dessert section was definitely a bliss. It consisted of a huge variety of pastries, indian sweets, ice cream and toppings. macrons was definitely a highlight. There was huge chaos as the tables were all over the place and therr existing confusion among the crowd as to what dish was kept where. The replacing of empty dish bowls took sometime and the waiting was definitely was not part of the experience. But I would recommend the place for the food and the experience."
4,"Breakfast spread was exquisite. The varieties in south Indian and western were many. Ambience fantastic as one of the best parts was that the buffet breakfast was laid out in front of the kitchen. Quality of all cuisines excellent. The service was good. There was never a lack in anything asked for. Dinner - Open ravioli very good, pleasing to the palate although could do with little more spice. Also had the Mediterranean pizza and Thai cuisine which was very satisfying.Ambience amazing. Commendable."
4,Leela served up to expectation. Went here for birthday dinner and enjoyed the food thoroughly! Quantity served it just perfect for two people. We tried falafel and arrabbiata pasta - it was delicious. The ambience is so rich and classy we enjoyed our dinner and time spent here.
3,One of the well known restaurant in the city. Known for its brand name itself. Leela palace. No words about the ambiance. The service is fine. Food is also good. Fill ur pockets before u go there which is quite common in a star hotel.
4,"Awesome place with some great ambience and yummy food ...the chicken tacos n grilled paneer was worth a shot , great taste and presentation ..the sheek kababs just melted in the mouth with all the spices coming together beautifully well ....over all a good place to dine with friends once in a while .....cheers"
3,"I rarely dine at citrus the way I used to, coz somewhere along the way the taste of food went downhill...also it was shut for a long time as it was being renovated..the new decor is not that great when one compares it with other leela restaurants ...the food is just ok but service is fantastic!"
4,"Must try: pending We went for deserts as our dinner was really sad (serafina). The staff were great, the place was exquisite, desserts were good ( I don't understand art in food - I just understand simply superb tasting food). Overall, it's a nice experience - go there if u have deep pockets. 4 desserts - 2.2k, but then again u just don't pay for food here.. U pay for the experience, and the experience for me was worth it."
3,"Buffet is good Ç ,bit high cost !!! can have a varities and breakfast is very tasty as you can find the varities of jiuces infact with breads as well south indian dishes .................."
3,"While the ambience is good, the citrus offers the buffet dinner. ~2500 per person. Average selection, nothing great about the buffet. I did not like the value for money."
2,"Easter Brunch 2016 - ordered a small pizza at the buffet station; 20min later nothing. Asked staff to check, 10mi later still nothing. Asked manager to check, 10min later (you guessed it) - nothing. Paid bill and left. Utterly abysmal service; staff does not care or is motivated in the slightest."
3,The service as always is fantastic. We had a Margherita pizza and orange juice. One of the best orange juice I've had but I've had better pizzas.
4,There breakfast spread is just amazing. ...surprisingly I love the IDLY what they make in their kitchen...I usually go back to citrus for those melt in your mouth idly's
4,"Great ambience with a palatial feel throughout....loved the Ç overall architecture of the palace decorated with nascent Rose flowers throughout the Hotel .Greeted well by Citrus Restaurant Manager Mr. Kushal who remembered my advance reservation well and helped me choose between Citrus & Jamavar. I preferred Citrus for the bright lighting as my 1 yr old son becomes cranky in dark lighting.Appreciate the service of 2 to 3 attendants who cared for us throughout and helped us choose the starters , main course meals.Also would mention I was even offered 2 bananas on demand for my son who was by 9 30 pm becoming bit cranky.Was also offered to visit the poolside , lobby Ç for a shot stroll in between meals.All was good except the Mutton Roganjosh which is supposed to be distinguished by its thick, aromatic, flavourful red sauce and tender meat but somehow the meat was too tight. :-(.Still food , service , ambience I would rate 4*."
4,"Amazing spread of buffet, came here today for their lunch buffet (I.e. On a Wednesday) and loved every part of the same. Starting from Ambience to service to food and my favorite desserts.A must visit for all dessert lovers."
4,An elegant place to be. Tasty multi cuisine food ranging from Italian to Asian. Courteous staff who are always eager to make your experience worthwhile. Only request of sort that I have is they should add more Indian vegetarian dishes to their menu.
4,"The wood oven pizza, middle eastern meatball starter and the macaroons are amazing! Spent a lovely evening sipping on a chilled Australian chardonnay and enjoying the food. The restaurant is pretty empty during the week, so you can take advantage of having a nice al fresco dinner without any disturbance from other guests."
4,"Must try for the breakfast lovers. Tried it on Sunday morning. Spoilt for choices. Loved the fresh coconut water,Egg Benedict and peach flavour French Toast. However sunday special chole bhature and aalo paratha were disappointing. One must go for the ambience and variety"
4,Definitely among the best 5* coffee shops in Bangalore. Fairly wide spread of dishes across different cuisines and most of the food is fairly well prepared. You will be spoiled for choice!Relaxed lively atmosphere and great seating options - indoor as well as outdoor. If weather permits choose outdoor as it is by the pool and they have a nice water feature as well that adds to the experience.This is one place you can really feel the vibrancy and energy of India's Silicon Valley!
5,"IÇÑm keeping this review short. Almost everything I tried was delicious, the highlight for me was the Orange glazed pork chops falling off the bone and the baked lamb.Thank you Team Citrus, Arup and Rishi for taking great care of us.Enjoy the pics!"
5,"One of the best buffet place in town ..excellent ambience , very good service, good spread. This is the fourth time I am visiting, still not getting bored of this place . If you want to impress anyone this is the place you should take them, and be rest assured they will be impressedRecommendation: Keep the vegetarian and non veg separate, especially cutlery in the buffet rack."
3,"Citrus- cosy,beautiful,large,elegant,live music etc etc. Here I am writing my review about \"
3,"One thing that you just can't ignore, once u enter Leela palace is its sheer Grandeur.It is true to its name and there is no stone left unturned to make this place look like a Palace.Coming to the Citrus restaurant, the ambiance is though good, not great. The service was quite good, all our requests were promptly attended to. The buffet spread was quite good, but my biggest complaint would be that there was a serious lack of variety in Veg starters. Other than that, overall it was a satisfactory experience given you are not the person looking for value for money. The Grandeur of the hotel makes up for any shortcomings and will make it a memorable experience."
3,There is nothing much to review about this place as we went here around 1 in the night after a movie when there was nothing else open! (It was a weekday)We weren't really hungry and were looking for some hot beverages anyway.Place is fab! You can visit the place just for the place once!Ordered a Veg sandwich and a herbal tea and a coffee.It was all OK. Nothing exceptional yet nothing bad as well.We sat and spoke for like an hour so so and then at around 2.15 the staff came with cleaning brooms! Though they never asked us to leave we took the hint!Surely will visit for food once and write a detailed review

3,"The Citrus in Leela .... As we feel, yeah , I really had a good time having their food there.I had taken the buffet and it was dinner time . Liked most of the dishes . But couple of them were not to the mark. Pita bread, pasta and soup were a lil bad. They did not have much options for veggies ... I guess they must include more live counters and varieties for veg eating ppl too ."
4,"Lavish spread and for the price on a Weekday Lunch it is very good. Service is top-notch.Being a non-veg got to try the variety of meat available. Veg also had lot of variety unlike other buffet places. Obvious stamp of a 5* buffet.Ç Apart from that the spread has Chinese, Thai, Indian, continental, various cheese, breads and susi as well. Desserts were the high point with great tasting pastries, jamuns and halwas! Icecreams are a must try!"
4,"If you are looking for one place that houses all types of cuisine, your search ends here! Yes! The mega Sunday brunch at Citrus, leela is going to pamper your foodbuds to the extent that you would desire to have food nowhere else. Each counter (almost 6 of them) served a different cuisine starting from Thai to French,waffles, wantons, Susi, salads, Bou,macaroon, different types of cheese, name it and you have it! My personal favorite were the Thai and the continental assortments! Couldn't get over the desserts! The best thing is the royal experience....you can't experience it elsewhere in the midst of busy Bangalore!Ambience: 5 ( lush greenery and the palace in its midst)Food: 5Price:4Overall :5"
4,"Had been here in the night for dinner at around 1 o'clock!We just had a Thai curry along with basmati rice.I must tell you,one of the best Thai curries I have ever had.And the aroma of the basmati rice was tempting!Loved the lightings and the ambience.Good service by the waiters there.Amazing experience."
4,"Fantastic experience always. Lazy Sunday brunches are an experience. Amazing ambiance, elaborate and tasty spread coupled with great service. Makes your day. The Leela Palace has always been one of my favourites, especially because of the grandeur and the magnificent architecture. It's a beautiful property."
4,"I was turning 30,Ç and Ç I didn't want to celebrate my birthday the typical way - blowing candles and cutting a cake at midnight and taking pictures in pajamas. So we decided to head to the Leela Palace at midnight to have a cake along with coffee. ItÇ was Christmas time and this place is lit up beautifully and there were different variety of cakes onÇ display. Although we ordered a cheese cake along with cappuccino.Ç See pics and read the post to get more details."
4,"I had gone there for lunch on a weekday and I opted for the buffet.... There was a wide range of spread with variety of meats like pork,beef, mutton and chicken... I loved the pork salads and the pork main course, its the best pork I've ever had, fish was ok ....paneer quality was very bad it was hard and tasted sour, Indian cuisine was moderate but the lamb of exceptional , their continental section was great and salads were very different and tasty... Coming to the deserts they wer heavenly , the red velvet cake being the best..... They do not serve prawns in their regular buffet so it was little disappointing as it is lil expensive"
4,"Amazing lunch buffet .. A must try for all food lovers .. The Pork belly they serve @ times is amazing .. Excellent main course as well as spread covers Indian ( both South and North ) , Continental , Pan Asian as well as Arabic .. Value for moneyThe break fast buffet is equally good and sumptuous"
3,"Great staff. If you need anything special to eat or drink, the staff will get it for you. Every morning, the buffet is fully staffed and you have a lot of choices of fresh food."
5,Best Sunday Brunch in town ! :) Delicious food and Excellent setup. Variety with Quality is the statement for Citrus's Sunday Brunch......
3,The ambience is good .Things to try Citrus caeser salad .chicken tikka makahni is yummy.The burgers they serve is not that great..everything is quite ok ...
4,Everything was fine....the ambience was good....the interiors of the hotel will make u fall in love with it....some of the items were good and rest all r way too bad even to have a taste
1,I would call my experience as \
1,"Outstanding spread and great food. But very, very poor staff behavior. I say it not because of my personal experience but also of a few that I saw around us. My anniversary got spoilt by lies that threw around and dishonored our booking. They took a long 30 mins to attempt to undo that but provided a make-shift table which was again a terrible experience as it created inconvenience to us and the other guests. I am appalled at such behavior from staff of Leela especially because I have been to each and every property of theirs and have been a huge fan. There is so feeling or countenance of apology from the staff, who seem to be busy for nothing. And yes, I do strongly feel that there is a preferential treatment that they cater. Highly recommend you to stay away if you like to be treated even half decently at an premium hotel."
4,"the finest in the city ,... If you love your spread to be massive , delicious,,, mouth watering ... This place just makes me feel more hungry after eating ... Defo a place to go ..............."
5,A spread that is so huge and varied that you need to visit it a couple of times to try everything on offer. A perfect place for a family brunch.
4,"The ambience is very impressive, and the different shades of light give you a comforting feel. The service is also very good, and the menu has a huge range of options ranging from Italian, to Asian to delicious imported meats which get cooked fresh of the grill.Ç The mocktail which i had was really awesome and a refreshing one. And the biriyani too. Went with my boyfriend. Would love to visit again, whenever possible."
5,"It will be unfair if i don't rate today's Lunch - Buffet experience as 5.Yummy Food, up to the mark services and friend make this lunch memorableThe spread is huge and as per your taste bud you get good option to enjoy your buffet..As per my taste bud...Killer items were Polenta Cake( Veg ) , Fish Fry , Spinach Gravy and creme brulee..{ There was so many item but these were few which i server my self twice :-) }"
5,"I tell yu Ladies and Gentlemen, simply the best best Idlis i have ever tasted anywhere.. from homes to road side eateries ....Soft, softer, amazing texture and the wafting smells ..so fresh so good..i am willing to travel almost 2 hours next time to stay there just for this..cheers..ajay"
3,Went to Citrus with some of my friends. Ambience is really good. But the staff is not friendly. At all. We were restricted entry at the entrance. After some argument they finally let us sit in tglhecafe. Totally unexpected. Not a kind of treatment you expect from a Leela hotel.
4,"I have been going to leela for some time now, and usually land up at citrus. The ambience is very impressive, and the different shades of light give you a comforting feel. The service is very good, and the menu has a huge range of options ranging from Italian, to Asian to delicious imported meats which get cooked fresh of the grill. In my recent visit, I ordered the Pork and shrimp wonton broth as well as the Club sandwich consisting of bacon, chicken, lettuce and all the other colorful veggies :)The broth was excellent but the club sandwich was OK, it didn't exactly punch my palate. Food is on the pricey side, but its the same with any other five star hotel in Bangalore. Overall a good meal, we will be visiting again soon!"
3,"Was with some friends from my industry and was waiting for the staff to show up to take the order and the delay went on for 30 mins and the floor manager was forced to take the order. But Food was amazing and the delays were well taken care :)Good : Amazing Decor, Great FoodBad : Crazy Staff who kept us waiting :(Ugly :Tips to starters : Try Mutton Kebabs :)"
4,"Went for breakfast buffet... they had large n beautiful spread with indian, asian, european and mediteranean options. The service was just fantastic. We wete served a wrong order but it was corrected in no time by the server. Eye catching was the way they served tender coconut water, it was served whole on bed of ice. The only thing that i couldn't accept was the taste of mysore masala dosa,as it was served sweet with carrot like paste in it. Everything served on the buffet is worth having it. A must try breakfast buffet in bangalore."
4,"I have very good memories in citrus with many friends in different ocassion , that way it is one of special place in Bangalore . I like the genuine good feel factor their staff trying to do with all the customers . I love the range of food available in the menu . I have done breakfast too here & the filter coffee what they serve in silver cup is the best :)"
3,"We went to Citrus in Leela Palace for breakfast today. We got in a little late so decided to order a la carte instead of the buffet. The choices for breakfast are pretty extensive, and there was enough choice to keep everyone satisfied. We ordered both Indian as well as continental dishes; ie, Idli, Rava dosa, pancakes, bagels, and wafflesThe Indian food was pretty standard, not much to say about that. The waffles were don really well. They were pretty crisp on the outside and felt dense. They were also finished with cinnamon which was nice.Ç The pancakes as well had a generous dusting of powdered sugar and copious amounts of chocolate chips (They'll make the pancakes to your specifications)I really enjoyed the way the coffee was served in a HUGE silver tumbler. It was authentic!The thing I did not like however was the awkward wait to get a table (Probably because we did not have a reservation) and the table we were given which was sort of in a corner of the restaurant, I saw many other free tables that were in better locations- but I assumed they were reserved or something so I did not voice this.It was an okay meal, but I've definitely had better in the city. For such a big hotel, they gotta step up their game!"
3,"Dinner at a coffee shop is not my idea of great evening out, but was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. There's not much you can do for decor and ambience in a coffee shop, but it was difficult to find any fault with the food. Service was decent, wine was good. Not bad at all."
3,See it's Leela Palace so whenever you will enter you will feel happiness !!Now about food. I went for Lunch buffet.The moment i entered in the dining area i found the spread is huge but once i started opting for the dishes i found it quite less seeing the price as well as the reputation of the place.Lack of salad spread/ Lack of Main course spread/ Lack of desert.My colleague told me that momos are quite tasty and once i reach there Momos were out of stock and the service guy told me to serve it on table and he came back when i have almost finished my lunch (i will consider it as pathetic service seeing the reputation of the place). he insisted me to taste at least but i said common i have even finished my desert.Taste wise i found this place OK.Spread were really spread in a huge area but were less in numbers.Not worth value of money.
4,"A class redefined, food, experience and ambience best of all the world....peaceful retreat of senses, puts Ç big hole in the pocket but worth every penny spend once a while! most of our business interactions and meetings we chose this place as in the city but away from the busy crowd, we tried the prawns and the kababs and they really surprised us with the quality and taste ...."
4,"Needless to say, its one of the best restaurants in Bangalore. they have amazingly delicious cake house there. the veg food isn't that great, most of their veg dishes are mildly spiced but the non-veg is just mind blowing! must try lamb. The service and attention given to customers is very good."
4,"I, along with my family went to Citrus on 14th May, 2015 for lunch. It is one of my favourite restaurants. As usual, lunch buffet spread was large. The continental items were really enjoyable. The desert section had a lot of varieties. Quality of the food was top, as expected in such a restaurant, The staff members were courteous. In fact, on that day, there was no item like smoked salmon, though earlier multiple times, we had that item there as part of buffet. When my wife asked if on that day salmon was there or not, the waiter brought the item even though it was not there on the menu.Ç Once again, we returned with good experience and satisfaction.Ç We will try to go there many more times in future."
3,"Went there on a Friday night around 11 pm.Jamavar was closed at that time.So if u came out of leela pub and want to have dinner, this you will find open.Place is nice,good ambience.We ordered soup in starter and it was yummy.And to test the place we ordered pizza and it was good thin crust pizza.:)"
4,"I think when u go to leela u already made your mind to pay . Same happened to me . Went to check out food here .nothing almost less than 1k per plate here . 2 items cost me 2.5 k. But if you keep aside the price , the food was awesome .the beef and the jasmine rice was mind boggling, I think I hardly had better beef anywhere . Most of places makes beef with too much masala which you can feel while having food , but here it was so smooth . I must say with the price the provide good portion , so don't too hurry in ordering too much . Take your time and enjoy your food ."
5,"Great Italian food by what you get in India. Good vegetarian choices. Very affordable wine list. Service was excellent, and attentive. The presentation was good."
4,"Had been for a corporate dine. No comments on ambiance, it's a palace as the name itself indicates. U feel like ur in palace. The food quality was also good. Donno about the buffet dinner cost & all as it as corporate dine."
5,"A calm and royalish place to have breakfast in the morning. You will find endless options to choose from South Indian , North Indian , French , continental , Chinese , whatnot . For all the South Indians, the pleasure will be having filtered coffee in the extra large silver cup :) "
5,"By far one of the best places in bangalore. Great food, ambience and above all excellent service. It turned out to be a expensive choice but worth every penny you pay!!"
4,"Went to celebrate my friend bday since we were in mood of having some grand bday party . They treated us very well and allowed us to cut our own special.cake as well :) . We ordered few things and everything was up to the mark including pizza, mushrooms roll (forgot the exact name) , and biryani. Ambience is nice and relaxing."
4,One of the best buffet lunch ever had the taste still holds on my taste buds Worth every penny that u spend hereIndian Chinese continental wow just too perfect ?Ambience service food brilliant Deserts were truly Heaven ? Divya Karthikeyan The chef specially got us these chocolate desert which was really yummy but v wer so full to finish it
3,"As some food critic famously stated that a buffet is a plunging neckline of gastronomy. It definitely is.Buffets are generally those places when you should visit when you can a) either eat a horse or b) you need all those cuisines c) you neednÇÑt order for a group. I fell in category A. Anyone who opts for a buffet definitely has seen something there that he wants, he really wants. The Banoffie Pie Verine was that thing for me.Despite how the quality and the quantity of the spread was, Citrus would have been on my wish list had I not been there last weekend. Lets split the buffet this way:1.Ç Ç Ç Ç Ç Ç Ç SALADS - The Salads were separate for the Veg and Non-Veg (including cold cuts).2.Ç Ç Ç Ç Ç Ç Ç SOUPS Ç A Veg soup and a Non-Veg soup3.Ç Ç Ç Ç Ç Ç Ç LIVE COUNTER Ç of sorts. You could order your Mutton Sheek or Chicken Kabas. (Order only the Mutton Sheek here, the rest you will find around the corner near your house)4.Ç Ç Ç Ç Ç Ç Ç MAIN COURSE - The spread is short of lavish with Indian (for the south Indians, this might be home. They had dishes whose names I do not recall properly but have seen in a lot of homes), Chinese (limited option of Egg fried rice, chilli chicken, hot garlic fish, chilli corn, noodles), others including mushroom crepes, Ç French toast, chocolate chip pancakes etc.5.Ç Ç Ç Ç Ç Ç Ç DESSERTS -The centre of attraction is always the desserts. All the colours of the rainbow spread out in different forms and sizes are definitely attractive and appealing.6.Ç Ç Ç Ç Ç Ç Ç MISC - You also get a choice between a Beer, Lemon Soda or an Iced TeaService- I think you experience what real good service was, one had to dine at the OberoiÇÑs. They have become a benchmark of sorts. Given this, the service was very mediocre at Citrus.Value for money Ç In all, there may be a lot of food to choose from, however, it would not be appropriate to say that it was the best buffet experience. May it be known that the same costs about 2000/- with taxes.Oh and that banoffie pie verine, I left that half eaten."
3,"Within the city, wherein one suffers from traffic jams, pollution etc, The Leela Palace takes you away from all this. So much of greenery.. lovely infrastructure.. Well maintained & a nice calm place. Went with my family for a visit to Leela Mall which wasnt fascinating at all..!! Hardly any stores inside, so thought of having some talks over a cup of tea/coffee.. The garden area is really well maintained. Full of beautiful trees. The entry to reception is again a palace style. Also the moment you enter you are can smell a lovely fragrance that will sooth your mood. After the reception you will see their Bar-The Library on your left and Jamavar on your right. Thereafter, on your left you will see their in-house bakery shop that has beautiful cakes made up and pastries designed so cute that you will jump eating one of them. We preffered the outside seating area. You can enjoyview of the tall green coconut trees, their in-house gym and back side of their rooms from here. Ordered one pastry, Mint tea, Masala Tea ans a filter coffee. The only good thing about this place was it ambience and my mint tea as rest all things served to us were not at all 5 star quality. I'm sorry to say but we were a little disappointed. Pastry was more like a biscuit (hard to crack) and less sponge. Masala tea again was below average and same for filter coffee. I hope they work on it. Also, we were thinking to have dinner sometime but now it will be in my last choices. Total cost rs1300. Go only if you want to feel special."
4,This is best ever place i could suggest for official business meeting lunch or dinner the ambience here was coolFood 4/5.Ambience 4.5/5.Services 4.5/5.Overall 4.5
4,#Taste the Rich !!The ambiance here is magnificent and their menu shows a great blend of items combined with classy tastes. Citrus cuisine represents the staff's experience of cookery.For me it's a one time visit for its Decor and Food !!
4,Ambience-checkFood-check Pool-check that's all u need on a Sunday!Have come to this place 3-4times now and charmed as ever!Kempinski is just too classy and trendy with good food and musicCitrus is multicuisine with live counters and variety of buffet spread Bit higher on pocket but worth it ;) 
4,"The citrus @ leela provides a spectacular ambiance and has a killing grandeur. The staff albeit courteous is a bit non-responsive though. I actually went in for dinner here rather than breakfast. The green curry with vegetables, an Asian delight, was truly remarkable. The plain looking dish surprised our taste buds to the core. Highly recommended. The Mediterranean gourmet pizza and the Mexican falafel were not great but not bad either. The soups and mocktails were disappointing though. Would explore other restaurants in leela than repeating this place."
4,"As you arrive at the Leela for brunch on Sunday the majestic main porch gives you an insight of what to expect. As you walk towards citrus parents would be relieved to notice a nice large play pen where they can dispose their kids. Move ahead and you will find a virtual golf setup for some 'virtual exercise' in-between courses. The restaurant the last time I was there seemed more spacious but now a little less so as they have built a glass enclosure between the main restaurant and the alfresco. Now that we have established the ambience, lets brunch...The enormity of the buffet spread is what hits you straight away. I appreciated that despite the large numbers being catered to, the chefs took the time to elegantly display the dishes with most items having individual portions. The brunch was made even more special with both the chefs and wait staff attentively yet not obtrusively attending to the guests. There was a cheerful energy with Bangalore's acclaimed weather ensuring that we felt nice and lazy.My only gripe was with the dessert selection. It was not as elaborate which I can cope with but more importantly it lacked creativity which was synonymous with the rest of the brunch. My family also felt that the portion sizes were too large which didn't allow for them to experiment. Also, the virtual golf could be included for those opting for the champagne brunch.I experienced the brunch at Citrus almost two years back as I was told that it was the one to beat in the city, I am pleasantly astonished that despite the influx of so many more options in the city, the Citrus champagne brunch is still by far the best brunch offering in the city."
5,The name itself suggests the theme....refreshing and colourful Their garden buffet theme was vibrant and exotic at the same time....kudos to the chef for the innovation Food: Typical leela style sumptuous...special mention to the salads and desserts Ambience: perfect for a brunch with family and friendsService: attentive servers they cater to any special requests regarding choice of food and drinks and makes sure you leave the restaurant with a smile P. S. Deepak and his team Price: typical 5 star prices...but worth a splurge Overall: ≠êØè≠êØè≠êØè≠êØè≠êØè
3,"OVERALL:Food - 9.5 / 10Setting / Ambience - 8 / 10Service - 6 / 10Responsive of Staff - 4 / 10Will i return? - i'd visit Zen and/or Jamavar first (and i dont dine at Leela every other evening!)my rating(s) above is based on my perception of the overall experience (which includes food, service, ambiance, menu options and responsiveness and attention of the staff). my overall experience was NOT a \"
3,"I have a very different approach towards 24-hour coffee shops housed inside 5-star hotels which I think a lot of people tend to ignore. Given the limited menu, I would only go there when it's very late at night, order intelligently, and eat top-class food at almost reasonable prices. This is more applicable to Bangalore where eateries usually close very early. Citrus is probably about 21-hrs instead of 24-hours, but I'm not really complaining.Ambience: 3.5/5 Its Leela, so seating outdoors by the pool is delightful. However, that is available only till about 10pm. The indoor seating is okay, if at all a bit noisy.Food: 3.5/5 - Usually good and sometimes exceptional.Service: 4.5/5 - Kitchen starts closing around 2 AM but till then service is quite competent and they bring on the food pretty quickly.Value for money: 2/5 - This is one of the marquee hotels in Bangalore so you wouldn't really be looking for value for money here. But if you are careful with your orders, you won't burn a hole in your pocket either. And you will get all this well past midnight in a cosy setting.I'd recommend the salads and pizzas which are good enough for 2 or even 3 people with small appetites. I usually target spending under 1k per head. It's not difficult at all."
3,"The ambience could have been better though. It may be for lunches, but did not have much fun during the dinner.Also, I liked the salted butter. :D"
4,"I am a huge fan of English breakfasts and couple of us used to go to the Zen restaurant at Leela once every 6 months on a weekday. When we went few weeks back we learnt that they had opened Citrus for breakfasts. Overall the food menu remains almost same. Just that the venue has shifted. It is a feast you don't want to miss. Starting with an array of cut fresh fruits it definitely is a culinary experience you do not want to miss. The Danish pastry , the chocolate crossoint and the doughnut just melts in your mouth. Masala omelette and the waffles are good as well. And it is so difficult to choose what you want to eat In addition they even have Indian cuisine as well. So it is really a dilemma to choose what you want to eat. Dosa, Idli, vada, different types of eggs, baked beans, fried rice, noodles, aloo parantha, parfaits, smoothies, fresh fruit juices, pita bread and hummus, cheese platters. And all this for breakfast. Definitely go with an empty stomach and still you wouldn't have had half of the dishes. You are in food heaven and finish your meal with a glass of filter coffee."
4,"Mind blowing service, great variety of food. Ambience undoubtedly the best. You should plan well and choose this place for brunch . one of the most expensive brunch. if you are not a good eater. Your wasting your money."
3,"Citrus is all about good food, great variety and unbeatable quality! The lunch buffet is an absolute delight, a foodie never gets disappointed. Cold cuts, salads, mains and desserts are offered in a wide variety under Indian, continental and oriental.Ç The best thing about the buffet is the choice of dishes they offer ! I fell instantly in love with the fish fillets and bread and cheese. Dry beef in a spicy masala prepared in Mangalorean style was another favourite which went perfectly well with the Sanaz. Custom made chaat was another exciting option.Ç Barbecue in Indian and Western style was delectable, and satiates the meat lover! Beef steak was well done; juicy and perfect served with a sunny side up. The only exception to this was the lamb, which was bland and dull! The pepper sauce sure helped us finish it, but it could have been done better.Ç Citrus was a good find, I will definitely go back to explore more!"
3,Have had food around 6-7 times here after 1130 in the night. Goo prompt service. I love their biryani which has a tangy flavour and iced tea. Service is slow and pitiable.
2,"Visited this restaurant last weekend for a dinner and I was mighty impressed with the ambiance of the entire hotel in general .. well of course, its The Leela !But the good impression ended there. Citrus is okayish ... nothing exquisite in particular, no trademark recipe ... no Wow moments.The staff was sort of indifferent too. We had to ask for someone each time we needed something. There was no one waiting on us AT ALL.Ç The biryani is an insult to its name. It was just uncooked vegetables in flavored rice. Nothing more to it."
3,Been here 2weeks back and must say Leela ki ajab hi leela hai. Nice ambience but not great food. They did not hv Paneer item in main course for veg buffet..bit shocking..not much in salads as well. Just enjoyed loads of real fresh orange juice and french toast was real good.
3,"The ambience is great. The person who showed the way to the restaurant was very courteous. The person who showed us to our table however informed us the cost of the buffet, which was strange. The food was not that good, except for chicken varaval which was like chicken kebab and was an ok dish. Desert was also not that good. Overall the taste of food was disappointing. Service could have been better. There was only one cloth napkin at the table and there were two of us. Coffee was supposed to be part of the buffet, but was not offered and after experiencing the taste of the food, we didn't bother asking for it."
5,Good food. Splendid buffet breakfast. Really loved Middle east food including hummus khabus and vinegar salad which I did not find in any other buffet breakfast.
5,"the renovated restaurant is brilliant!!!!! Saturday brunch and Sunday brunch are seriously the BEST. on Sunday they have a cute area for kids and mini buffet for them so the grown up's can have fun too! Great band too. The grills are amazing as well as the cold section. The buffet is nicely spread out so you can walk around! its beautifully set up..so you eat with your eyes too! The desserts are fab. ( it's not a part of the buffet! but check out the ornamental cakes on display while you're walking in! they are adorable) . The staff is great they are all super friendly and helpful. seem like a happy lot who like what they do! Great food, great ambience, great staff - winning combination!"
3,"The place is renovated well and I do like it. Service seems slow on many occasions. Kind of gives me the feeling of a little gap in staff training towards WOW for customers. But again - on other occasions - its been fine too! A little friendliness from the waiters would help. Food at Leela is fine - cannot doubt that. But I place them well below Oberoi or ITC when it comes to serving coffee or tea. They need to learn a bit. We got served a completely cold coffee on 2-3 occasions. Not expected here but they have been kind enough to ensure its changed. My point is why does it happen so often. The new bakery there is good too. We enjoyed it. Menu is good and appropriate for the hotel coffee shop. Overall - we visit this place for its ambience and a change. Would like to see a change in the experience to want to go more often,"
3,lovely place to go on a date. The food is too good. Rich menu and so the food and the cakes are heavenly :)
1,"Disappointing..nothing great about the food, and had mosquitoes inside..While the staff got the coil, damage was done and mood spoiled"
4,I have been to citrus last sunday... Its an awesome place to enjoy variety of food.... Foodie will surely enjoy it... I would love to have more brunches ;)
3,Went to citrus for lunch with 2 other friends. They had a wide spread if food but felt a little disorganised. The ambience is nice and they also have a nice open seating. Overall it was decent and would definitely come back for more.
3,Loved the location and the food but waited very long to dine as the place was under renovation....Ambiance 5/5food 3/5
5,"Great food, good ambiance and decent service.....being a foodie, I was determined to find good places for brunch wid my buddies. The outdoor seating worked best for us. Staff is attentive. The variety of food available made it a value for money. Thumbs up to this one!"
2,Seriously overratted!!! There r far better restaurants with better ambience which makes much smaller hole in ur pockets. The fire and water theme doesnt feels like the way it sounds. Leela palace in itself is worth visiting but this restaurant is simply overpriced!!
3,"The breakfast/brunch buffet is just the right size. They've put together just enough dishes that you don't feel overwhelmed and the selection is pretty good. Bad - salads section. The salads were slathered with mayo and creamy dressings that took away the refreshing nature of the salads and left them overdressed, soggy and just not appetising. Good - Most items were well prepared, kept at the right temperature and were properly seasoned. The indian section had some great curries and they all tasted different and were pretty good. The dum brinjal and the coconut chicken curry were delectable. The duck biryani was well flavoured but the duck was overcooked and stringy. The oriental section was okay with the prawn dumplings standing out. The noodles were very oily and of a streetside nature. Excellent - the italian fish and the french toasts. Absolutely divine! Desserts were nothing exceptional."
4,"The place was well maintained and the people there make sure you're well looked after. The food is amazing. For anyone eating out regularly, I should warn you that it's slightly pricey. But the food is definitely worth it. The other day when I went to the Citrus I wasn't too hungry and couldn't pick anything on the menu light enough to eat. So they made me French fries and served me that with a cup of coffee. The fries were fresh and quite crispy, and the coffee wasn't that bad either. It was, in all, a pleasant dinner and I would definitely go back."
5,Sunday brunch is constantly amazing and the friendly welcome and service make you feel really glad you came. We always enjoy the time spent here and recommend you try Sunday Brunch - you won't be disappointed
3,"This restaurant in the Leela Palace has been an office team celebration favourite for a couple of years now. We have always had a good time here - savouring the food and ambiance alike. It was closed for renovation for a good part of this year, and reopened only a few months ago. This was my least enjoyable visit (only in terms of what the restaurant had to offer).Frankly, I don't see what significant impact the makeover has achieved. If anything, the buffet was more confusingly organized this time, with multiple tables and us not being clear what was where - later found out they had divided the tables/counters by cuisines, as a result of which you could find salads/starters/mains in multiple tables. It was quite confusing.The entire hotel was being readied for Christmas, and they were doing a good job of creating the atmosphere - even this restaurant had themed cakes at the entrance and enjoyable Christmas decorations without overdoing it. There were three main seating areas - inside seating (close to the food), a private room (for large groups, which we booked), and al fresco seating.The buffet spread is extensive - spanning multiple Indian, European, Chinese/Thai, and Arabic cuisines. The ones who knew their favourite type of food and stuck to that section seemed to enjoy their meal better than a few of us who wanted to sample every single item. We ended up tasting the best and worst of the meal, and the number of bad items was unfortunately too large to ignore. Whether I like the taste or not is a different matter, but I found several dishes too salty (which I don't expect at a star-hotel like this). Several people in my team, including myself, found the cold cuts quite unpalatable (a bit stinky, but I think it was more than just perception and opinion about cold cuts in general). Negatives aside, there were many items that scored well (pizzas, some of the meat dishes), and as I said, had I stuck to the ones that looked like safe bets, I may have enjoyed the overall meal better.The biggest saving grace of the meal was the desserts section. Some of my teamies seemed to have fonder memories of this from previous visits, but I found the continental desserts still capable of causing massive envy (to take photos of, and send to your friends who were not eating there!)While it provided a great setting for a team celebration (with the ambiance and the food variety), I personally did not find the food measuring up to this price point (~Rs.1500 per head) - I can find much better food at half this price, and the \"

1,Twice in a row my experience with Leela has been a disaster.. On both the occassions they served non-veg in the name of veg (inspite of raising the issue the first time and a written apology). The waiter had the audocity (or innocence) to confidently argue that it was veg... until I opened the Kebbe to show him that it was made of lamb !! Cold and soggy naans.The food was very very average and the service was poor. One of my collegue got his main course when we were all finished !!Utter disregard for the customer...
5,"I came for the grand reopening sunday buffet and it was beyond words. The stuff they had layed on was unimaginable! The quality, the decor, the variety was beyond words. I ended up having a completely fishy opening with different varieties of pickled herring, which was remarkable if not outstanding. They had oysters abd lobster aswell as shrimps so I went for the whole thing. Immense choice of breads from all over and a lot more starters from all over including an arabian section with hummus and all. I regretted having one stomach only. The life cooking stations were buzzing and offering a huge variety of mains. I went for creole pork and tagine. The latter I never had before abd it was a sweet discovery. The service was good as usual and I enjoyed sitting outside next to the slow n steady flow of water. One thing I disliked was the music but I generally do not need evergreens revived to enjoy my food. It got really scary when the singer left the stage with his mic abd sang on. eventually the guitarist came down playing aswell. it didn't make sense to me. At a price tag of 3k per adult excl. Taxes surely not cheap but for a special sunday treat surely the place to go. One thing not being there anynore was the gold leaf on the strawberries though the oear tarts are as good as ever. Plenty of granite and marble make for an impressive interior."
1,"Came over for my parents anniversary to Citrus , hoping food has gotten better after renovation..The food had been disappointing as always for our every visit prior to this renovation.This time around, AGAIN, the food and experience of dining was nothing better.I had even called n reserved a table,and had mentioned the occasion we were dining there for....Beef Rendang was amongst the order...and was an utter disaster ! More so, when the bill came along, the server had no idea we were looking forward to some dessert for the anniversary...We wrote it and gave them, that we would have to think many times before we ever go there again !"
4,"My parents took me here for a surprise dinner on the occasion of my 16th birthday with a few friends and family and I must say, the ambiance made my heart skip a beat. Literally. The Leela is as posh as it can get and I expected everything to be top notch and that is what I got-ish. We chose to sit outside as the weather was perfect and the blazing lamps of fire against the backdrop of elegant waterfall-fountains made feel I was in sync with the elements or something. We were a group of 6 and we had ordered a caeser salad, quesedilla, and some shorba for starters and for the main course, we ordered a pizza, fish curry with appam, vada kari, some biryani as well as dosa-based dish. For a gourmet restaurant, I was very pleased with the portions and when it comes to taste, the food was mind-numbingly scrumptious. With the plus points being said, I was VERY disappointed with the service. The maitre'ds were less than vigilant and even goofed up with our order. We asked for a tropical fruit punch and it did not arrive even after the entree. We requested the waiter to bring us the beverage but he was taken aback and said that no such order was placed! We ordered for the drink again and the guy took a good 30 mins to get it to us and that too only when we were almost done with the main course. When he came, he came with two glasses of it when we had ordered only for one. My friend opted to take it and everything was perfect until I took a sip of it and knew that I had had it a billion times earlier at home. TROPICANA MIXED FRUIT JUICE! Yes! That is what it was. 350 bucks for it too. I politely asked one of the waiters if the \"
