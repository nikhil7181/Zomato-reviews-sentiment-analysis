5,"nice place, bunty was very helpful and nice."
1,I ordered veg biryani but I got chicken biryani instead.we are very orthodox about these things and I am very serious about this concern.
1,Worst experience till date in Bangalore. None of the food items ordered were good plus the beer was just average.Iron hill is far better than this and on top I would say even Macaw was better than this place.
2,"Made a reservation and arrived 5 min before but of no use. Was made to wait 30 minutes and then given a table next to the washroom. Told them I'll wait and was given another table after 15 min which was even worse. Because I was hungry, I took that table and was told by Ankita that I'll be given another table soon but she disappeared. Went to the reception and requested Ankita again for table change, was again told 5 min but no one bothered. Even the food/drinks service was delayed a lot, had to follow up so many times. So don't visit this place on weekends as they just don't care with the huge rush they have."

Each brew boasted a unique flavor profile, leaving me spoiled for choice.The food at Byg Brewsky Sarjapur was a culinary delight. The chicken roast was succulent and flavorful, while the Danish mushroom croquettes were a delectable fusion of textures and tastes. The egg roast provided a comforting warmth, perfectly complementing the crispy and flavorful karari roti.What truly set this experience apart was the impeccable service and welcoming atmosphere. The staff were attentive and knowledgeable, enhancing the overall dining experience.In conclusion, my visit to Byg Brewsky Sarjapur was a memorable one.
